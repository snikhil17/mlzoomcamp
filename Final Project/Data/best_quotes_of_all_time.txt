ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS THE 16TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND ONE OF THE GREAT AMERICAN LEADERS.
HIS PRESIDENCY WAS DOMINATED BY THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR.

ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS BORN ON 12 FEBRUARY 1809 NEAR HODGENVILLE, KENTUCKY. HE WAS BROUGHT UP IN KENTUCKY,
INDIANA AND ILLINOIS. HIS PARENTS WERE POOR PIONEERS AND LINCOLN WAS LARGELY SELF-EDUCATED. IN 1836, HE QUALIFIED
AS A LAWYER AND WENT TO WORK IN A LAW PRACTICE IN SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS. HE SAT IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE FROM 1834
TO 1842 AND IN 1846 WAS ELECTED TO CONGRESS, REPRESENTING THE WHIG PARTY FOR A TERM. IN 1856, HE JOINED THE NEW
REPUBLICAN PARTY AND IN 1860 HE WAS ASKED TO RUN AS THEIR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.

IN THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, LINCOLN MADE HIS OPPOSITION TO SLAVERY VERY CLEAR. HIS VICTORY PROVOKED A CRISIS,
WITH MANY SOUTHERNERS FEARING THAT HE WOULD ATTEMPT TO ABOLISH SLAVERY IN THE SOUTH. SEVEN SOUTHERN STATES
LEFT THE UNION TO FORM THE CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, ALSO KNOWN AS THE CONFEDERACY. FOUR MORE JOINED
LATER. LINCOLN VOWED TO PRESERVE THE UNION EVEN IF IT MEANT WAR. FIGHTING BROKE OUT IN APRIL 1861. LINCOLN ALWAYS
DEFINED THE CIVIL WAR AS A STRUGGLE TO SAVE THE UNION, BUT IN JANUARY 1863 HE NONETHELESS ISSUED THE
EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION, WHICH FREED ALL SLAVES IN AREAS STILL UNDER CONFEDERATE CONTROL. THIS WAS AN
IMPORTANT SYMBOLIC GESTURE THAT IDENTIFIED THE UNION'S STRUGGLE AS A WAR TO END SLAVERY.

ON 19 NOVEMBER 1863, LINCOLN DELIVERED HIS FAMOUS GETTYSBURG ADDRESS AT THE DEDICATION OF A CEMETERY AT THE
SITE OF THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG, A DECISIVE UNION VICTORY THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE EARLIER IN THE YEAR.

ON 9 APRIL 1865, THE CONFEDERATE GENERAL ROBERT E LEE SURRENDERED, EFFECTIVELY ENDING THE WAR. IT HAD LASTED FOR
MORE THAN FOUR YEARS AND 600,000 AMERICANS HAD DIED. LESS THAN A WEEK LATER, LINCOLN WAS SHOT WHILE ATTENDING
A PERFORMANCE AT FORD'S THEATRE IN WASHINGTON DC AND DIED THE NEXT MORNING, 15 APRIL 1865. HIS ASSASSIN, JOHN
WILKES BOOTH, WAS A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THE CONFEDERACY.

ADOLF HITLER WAS BORN ON 20 APRIL 1889 IN BRAUNAU-AM-INN ON THE AUSTRIAN-GERMAN BORDER. HIS FATHER WAS A
CUSTOMS OFFICIAL. HITLER LEFT SCHOOL AT 16 WITH NO QUALIFICATIONS AND STRUGGLED TO MAKE A LIVING AS A PAINTER IN
VIENNA. THIS WAS WHERE MANY OF HIS EXTREME POLITICAL AND RACIAL IDEAS ORIGINATED.

IN 1913, HE MOVED TO MUNICH AND, ON THE OUTBREAK OF WORLD WAR ONE, ENLISTED IN THE GERMAN ARMY, WHERE HE WAS
WOUNDED AND DECORATED. IN 1919, HE JOINED THE FASCIST GERMAN WORKERS’ PARTY (DAP). HE PLAYED TO THE
RESENTMENTS OF RIGHT-WINGERS, PROMISING EXTREMIST 'REMEDIES' TO GERMANY'S POST-WAR PROBLEMS WHICH HE AND MANY
OTHERS BLAMED ON JEWS AND BOLSHEVIKS. BY 1921 HE WAS THE UNQUESTIONED LEADER OF WHAT WAS NOW THE NATIONAL
SOCIALIST GERMAN WoRKERS' PARTY (NSDAP or NAZI PaRTY).

IN 1923, HITLER ATTEMPTED AN UNSUCCESSFUL ARMED UPRISING IN MUNICH AND WAS IMPRISONED FOR NINE MONTHS, DURING
WHICH TIME HE DICTATED HIS BOOK ‘MEIN KAMPF' OUTLINING HIS POLITICAL IDEOLOGY. ON HIS RELEASE HE BEGAN TO REBUILD
THE NAZI PARTY AND USED NEW TECHNIQUES OF MASS COMMUNICATION, BACKED UP WITH VIOLENCE, TO GET HIS MESSAGE
ACROSS. AGAINST A BACKGROUND OF ECONOMIC DEPRESSION AND POLITICAL TURMOIL, THE NAZIS GREW STRONGER AND IN THE
1932 ELECTIONS BECAME THE LARGEST PARTY IN THE GERMAN PARLIAMENT. IN JANUARY 1933, HITLER BECAME CHANCELLOR

OF A COALITION GOVERNMENT. HE QUICKLY TOOK DICTATORIAL POWERS AND BEGAN TO INSTITUTE ANTI-JEWISH LAWS. HE ALSO
BEGAN THE PROCESS OF GERMAN MILITARISATION AND TERRITORIAL EXPANSION THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY LEAD TO WORLD WAR
Two. HE ALLIED WITH ITALY AND LATER JAPAN TO CREATE THE AXIS.

HITLER'S INVASION OF POLAND IN SEPTEMBER 1939 BEGAN WORLD WAR Two. AFTER MILITARY SUCCESSES IN DENMARK,
Norway AND WESTERN EUROPE, BUT AFTER FAILING TO SUBDUE BRITAIN IN 1941, HITLER ORDERED THE INVASION OF THE
Soviet UNION. THE JEWISH POPULATIONS OF THE COUNTRIES CONQUERED BY THE NAZIS WERE ROUNDED UP AND KILLED.
MILLIONS OF OTHERS WHOM THE NAZIS CONSIDERED RACIALLY INFERIOR WERE ALSO KILLED OR WORKED TO DEATH. IN
DECEMBER 1941, HITLER DECLARED WAR ON THE UNITED STATES. THE WAR ON THE EASTERN FRONT DRAINED GERMANY'S
RESOURCES AND IN JUNE 1944, THE BRITISH AND AMERICANS LANDED IN FRANCE. WITH SOVIET TROOPS POISED TO TAKE THE
GERMAN CAPITAL, HITLER COMMITTED SUICIDE IN HIS BUNKER IN BERLIN ON 30 APRIL 1945.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) Is THE INTELLIGENCE OF MACHINES AND ROBOTS AND THE BRANCH OF COMPUTER SCIENCE THAT
AIMS TO CREATE IT. Al TEXTBOOKS DEFINE THE FIELD AS "THE STUDY AND DESIGN OF INTELLIGENT AGENTS" WHERE AN INTELLIGENT
AGENT IS A SYSTEM THAT PERCEIVES ITS ENVIRONMENT AND TAKES ACTIONS THAT MAXIMIZE ITS CHANCES OF SUCCESS. JOHN
McCARTHY, WHO COINED THE TERM IN 1955, DEFINES IT AS "THE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING OF MAKING INTELLIGENT
MACHINES."

AI RESEARCH IS HIGHLY TECHNICAL AND SPECIALIZED, DEEPLY DIVIDED INTO SUBFIELDS THAT OFTEN FAIL TO COMMUNICATE WITH
EACH OTHER. SOME OF THE DIVISION IS DUE TO SOCIAL AND CULTURAL FACTORS: SUBFIELDS HAVE GROWN UP AROUND PARTICULAR
INSTITUTIONS AND THE WORK OF INDIVIDUAL RESEARCHERS. AI RESEARCH IS ALSO DIVIDED BY SEVERAL TECHNICAL ISSUES. THERE ARE
SUBFIELDS WHICH ARE FOCUSED ON THE SOLUTION OF SPECIFIC PROBLEMS, ON ONE OF SEVERAL POSSIBLE APPROACHES, ON THE USE
OF WIDELY DIFFERING TOOLS AND TOWARDS THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF PARTICULAR APPLICATIONS. THE CENTRAL PROBLEMS OF AI
INCLUDE SUCH TRAITS AS REASONING, KNOWLEDGE, PLANNING, LEARNING, COMMUNICATION, PERCEPTION AND THE ABILITY TO MOVE
AND MANIPULATE OBJECTS. GENERAL INTELLIGENCE (OR "STRONG AI") IS STILL AMONG THE FIELD'S LONG TERM GOALS. CURRENTLY
POPULAR APPROACHES INCLUDE STATISTICAL METHODS, COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND TRADITIONAL SYMBOLIC AI. THERE ARE
AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF TOOLS USED IN AI, INCLUDING VERSIONS OF SEARCH AND MATHEMATICAL OPTIMIZATION, LOGIC, METHODS
BASED ON PROBABILITY AND ECONOMICS, AND MANY OTHERS.

THE FIELD WAS FOUNDED ON THE CLAIM THAT A CENTRAL PROPERTY OF HUMANS, INTELLIGENCE—THE SAPIENCE OF HOMO SAPIENS—
CAN BE SO PRECISELY DESCRIBED THAT IT CAN BE SIMULATED BY A MACHINE. THIS RAISES PHILOSOPHICAL ISSUES ABOUT THE NATURE
OF THE MIND AND THE ETHICS OF CREATING ARTIFICIAL BEINGS, ISSUES WHICH HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED BY MYTH, FICTION AND
PHILOSOPHY SINCE ANTIQUITY. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF OPTIMISM, BUT HAS ALSO SUFFERED SETBACKS
AND, TODAY, HAS BECOME AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY, PROVIDING THE HEAVY LIFTING FOR MANY OF THE MOST
DIFFICULT PROBLEMS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE.

REAL STUPIDITY BEATS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE EVERY TIME.

THE BHAGAVAD GITA IS KNOWN AS THE SONG CELESTIAL. IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SACRED TEXT IN THE HINDU
TRADITION. THE BHAGAVAD GITA IS SOME 7OO VERSES AND IS A PART OF THE GREAT EPIC MAHABHARATA.

 

  

THE BACKDROP TO THE BHAGAVAD GITA IS THE BATTLE OF KURUKSHETRA BETWEEN THE PANDAVAS AND THE KAURAVAS. ARJUNA FINDS
HIMSELF RELUCTANTLY FIGHTING FOR THE PANDAVAS AGAINST HIS COUSINS THE KAURAVAS. BEFORE THE START OF THE BATTLE ARJUNA
IS A GIVEN A CHOICE BETWEEN HAVING THE HELP OF EITHER HIS BELOVED FRIEND KRISHNA OR THE ENTIRE ARMY OF KRISHNA. WITHOUT
HESITATION ARJUNA CHOSE TO HAVE SRI KRISHNA AS AN ADVISER, RATHER THAN HIS ARMY. MOST OF THE BHAGAVAD GITA COMPRISES
THE DISCOURSE THAT SRI KRISHNA GAVE TO HIS DISCIPLE ARJUNA ON THE BATTLEFIELD OF KURUSHETRA. THE BATTLE BECOMES A
SYNOPSIS FOR LIFE AND PROVIDES SRI KRISHNA THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN TO ARJUNA THE PHILOSOPHY OF YOGA AND VEDANTA, IN
A PRACTICAL AND MEANINGFUL WAY.

THE GITA BEGINS WITH SRI KRISHNA EXPLAINING THE ESSENCE OF MAN IS NOT THE BODY BUT THE IMMORTAL SOUL. ON THE EVE OF
BATTLE ARJUNA IS FILLED WITH DEEP MISGIVINGS; HE FEELS TO KILL HIS RELATIVES AND FRIENDS WOULD BE A GREAT SIN. BUT SRI
KRISHNA REPLIES THAT ARJUNA SHOULD NOT SEEM HIMSELF AS THE DOER. IT IS ONLY GOD WHO GIVES AND TAKES LIFE AWAY.
FURTHERMORE THE DEATH OF THE BODY DOES NOT HARM THE SOUL. AS THE IMMORTAL QUOTE OF THE GITA RUNS.

“THE SOUL MIGRATES FROM BODY TO BODY. WEAPONS CANNOT CLEAVE IT, NOR FIRE CONSUME IT, NOR WATER DRENCH IT, NOR
WIND DRY IT. THIS IS THE SOUL AND THIS IS WHAT IS MEANT BY THE EXISTENCE OF THE SOUL.”

BY REVEALING HIS UNIVERSAL FORM, ARJUNA VIEWS SRI KRISHNA AS NOT JUST A FRIEND, BUT AS AN AVATAR OR INCARNATION OF GOD.
IT IS QUITE APT TO NOTE THE ENGLISH WRITER CHRISTOPHER ISHERWOOD WOULD LATER COMMENT ON THE GITA AS BEING “LIKE A
UNIVERSITY LECTURE DELIVERED BY GOD.” THEIR RELATIONSHIP CHANGES FROM GOOD FRIENDS TO MASTER AND DISCIPLE. IT IS SRI

KRISHNA’S REVELATIONS THAT GIVE THE GITA ITS DIVINE POWER. SANJAYA THE SCRIBE OF THE GITA REMEMBERED THE WORDS OF SRI
D KRISHNA AND THIS IS WHY THE GITA IS USUALLY LOOKED UPON AS SRUTI, OR REVEALED KNOWLEDGE. EVEN THOUGH TECHNICALLY THE
GITA IS SMRTI BECAUSE IT WAS LATER REMEMBERED AND WRITTEN DOWN BY SANJAYA.

FZAGE 20) } EVERYTHING ELSE SEEMS SO SUPERFLUOUS. - ALBERT EINSTEIN
 FACE 21

It is better to live your own destiny imperfectly than to live an imitation of somebody else's life
with perfection.

A gift is pure when it is given from the heart to the right person at the right time and at the right
place, and when we expect nothing in return.

No one who does good work will ever come to a bad end, either here or in the world to
come.

I have become Death, the destroyer of worlds.

As a man can drink water from any side of a full tank, so the skilled theologian can
wrest from any scripture that which will serve His purpose.

It is true that the mind is restless and difficult to control. But it can be conquered,
through regular practice and detachment. Those who lack self-control will find it
difficult to progress in meditation; but those who are self-controlled, striving
earnestly through the right means, will attain the goal.

Knowledge, the object of knowledge and the knower are the three factors, which
motivate action; the senses, the work and the doer comprise the threefold basis of
action.

For certain is death for the born... And certain is birth for the dead... Therefore, over
the inevitable Thou shouldst not grieve.

 

 

 
 [ANAS ov)

There has never been a time when you and I have not existed, nor will there be a time when we
will cease to exist. As the same person inhabits the body through childhood, youth, and old
age, so too at the time of death he attains another body. The wise are not deluded by these

a arbetexacs

Those who eat too much or eat too little, who sleep too much or sleep too little, will

not succeed in meditation. But those who are temperate in eating and sleeping, work

and recreation, will come to the end of sorrow through meditation.

Still your mind in me, still yourself in me, and without a doubt you shall be united
with me, Lord of Love, dwelling in your heart.

Not by refraining from action does man attain freedom from action. Not by mere
renunciation does he attain supreme perfection.

As person abandons worn-out clothes and acquires new ones, so when the body is
worn out a new one is acquired by the Self, who lives within.

Out of compassion I destroy the darkness of their ignorance. From within them |
light the lamp of wisdom and dispel all darkness from their lives.

No work stains a man who is pure, who is in harmony, who is master of his life,
whose soul is one with the soul of all.

SIDDHARTHA WAS BORN IN NORTHERN CENTRAL INDIA, IN THE YEAR OF 567 B.C. HE WAS BORN INTO THE KSHATRIYA CASTE.
HIs WAS BIRTH PRECEDED BY A SERIES OF VISIONS SEEN BY HIS MOTHER AND PROPHECIES MADE TO HIS FATHER.
THE PROPHECIES MADE TO HIS FATHER STATED THAT HE WOULDN'T BE A MAHARAJAH BUT A GREAT RELIGIOUS LEADER.

WHEN HE WAS BORN HIS FATHER SHIELDED HIM FROM THE AWARENESS OF THE WORLDS REALITIES. HIS WAS TRAINED IN THE HINDU
FAITH. SOMETHING UNUSUAL THAT HAPPENED BEFORE HIS BIRTH WAS WHEN A SACRED WHITE ELEPHANT, WHICH TOUCHED HIS MOTHER'S
SIDE WITH A LOTUS, IMPREGNATED HER.

SIDDHARTHA GREW UP IN LUXURY, SECURELY PROTECTED FROM ANYTHING UNPLEASANT. HE LATER MARRIED BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS
YASODARAH, DAUGHTER OF A NEIGHBORING MAHARAJAH. THEY HAD A SON AND NAMED HIM PRINCE RAHULAH. HIS TUTOR WAS
CHANNAH, HIS FATHERS MOST TRUSTED SERVANT. HE WAS ADVISED TO TUTOR AND GUARD SIDDHARTHA AND TO TEACH HIM TO EXERCISE
CONSTANT VIGILANCE SO THAT SIDDHARTHA MAY NEVER EXPERIENCE THE REALITIES OF LIFE (THE PREDICTIONS).

SIDDHARTHA BEGAN TAKING TRIPS TO A NEAR BY CITY WITH A SERVANT, AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SAW THE REALITY OF LIFE. THREE
THINGS THAT SIDDHARTHA SAW THAT DEEPLY DISTURBED HIM WAS AN OLD LADY BENT OVER WITH AGE, A MAN WHOSE BODY WAS
RAVAGED WITH LEPROSY AND A FUNERAL CART CARRYING A DEAD BODY. SIDDHARTHA COULD NOT GET THE "MEANING OF LIFE"
QUESTION "WHY DO PEOPLE SUFFER"? OUT OF HIS HEAD. HE SPENT MANY HOURS A DAY TRYING TO FIND THE ANSWER IN THE VEDAS
BUT FAILED MISERABLY.

TO FIND THE ANSWERS TO HIS QUESTIONS, HE FIRST TRIED TO FOLLOW THE PATH OF ASCETICISM, BY DENYING HIM PHYSICAL PLEASURES
AND BY EATING A SINGLE GRAIN OF RICE A DAY. THIS FAILED WHEN HE COLLAPSED FROM ANEMIC EXHAUSTION. HE THEN TRIED TO STUDY.
HE SPENT MANY HOURS A DAY READING THE VEDAS, LOOKING FOR CLUES ON LIFE'S MYSTERIES. DURING THIS PERIOD SIDDHARTHA'S LIFE
WAS VERY BORING AND SIMPLE. HE WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN FINDING ANSWERS BECAUSE HE WAS LOOKING IN THE WRONG PLACES.

FRANKLIN WAS A STATESMAN, DIPLOMAT, WRITER, SCIENTIST AND INVENTOR, ONE OF THE MOST VERSATILE AND TALENTED
MEN IN COLONIAL AMERICA AND A LEADING FIGURE IN THE AMERICAN STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE.

BENJAMIN FRANKLIN WAS BORN IN BOSTON ON 17 JANUARY 1706. HE ATTENDED SCHOOL ONLY BRIEFLY, AND THEN HELPED HIS

FATHER, WHO WAS A CANDLE AND SOAP MAKER. HE WAS APPRENTICED TO HIS BROTHER, A PRINTER, AND BEGAN WRITING

ANONYMOUSLY FOR HIS BROTHER'S NEWSPAPER. FRANKLIN AND HIS BROTHER QUARRELLED, AND IN 1723 FRANKLIN RAN AWAY TO
PHILADELPHIA. AFTER 18 MONTHS IN LONDON, FRANKLIN SETTLED IN PHILADELPHIA, ESTABLISHING HIMSELF AS A PRINTER. HE BOUGHT
THE

"PENNSYLVANIA GAZETTE’, WHICH HE EDITED AND WHICH BECAME ONE OF THE AMERICAN COLONIES’ MAJOR NEWSPAPERS. HE ALSO
WROTE AND PUBLISHED 'POOR RICHARD'S ALMANACK', AN ASTRONOMY JOURNAL.

By 1748, FRANKLIN HAD MADE ENOUGH MONEY TO RETIRE FROM BUSINESS AND CONCENTRATE ON SCIENCE AND INVENTING. HIs
INVENTIONS INCLUDED THE FRANKLIN STOVE AND THE LIGHTNING ROD. HE DEMONSTRATED THAT LIGHTNING AND ELECTRICITY ARE
IDENTICAL WITH HIS FAMOUS KITE EXPERIMENT. FRANKLIN ALSO BECAME MORE ACTIVE IN POLITICS. HE WAS CLERK OF THE
PENNSYLVANIA ASSEMBLY (1736-1751), A MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY (1750-1764), AND DEPUTY POSTMASTER FOR THE COLONIES
(1753-1774), REORGANISING THE POSTAL SERVICE TO MAKE IT EFFICIENT AND PROFITABLE.

FRANKLIN WAS ALSO INVOLVED IN MANY PUBLIC PROJECTS, INCLUDING FOUNDING THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY, A
SUBSCRIPTION LIBRARY AND, IN 1751, AN ACADEMY WHICH LATER BECAME THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA.

FROM 1757 TO 1774, FRANKLIN LIVED MAINLY IN LONDON WHERE HE WAS THE COLONIAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR PENNSYLVANIA,
GEORGIA, NEW JERSEY AND MASSACHUSETTS. HIS ATTEMPTS TO RECONCILE THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT WITH THE COLONIES PROVED
FRUITLESS. ON HIS RETURN TO AMERICA, THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE HAD ALREADY BROKEN OUT AND HE THREW HIMSELF INTO THE
STRUGGLE. IN 1776, HE HELPED TO DRAFT, AND WAS THEN A SIGNATORY TO, THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. HIS ILLEGITIMATE
SON WILLIAM, ROYAL GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY BETWEEN 1762 AND 1776, REMAINED LOYAL TO BRITAIN, CAUSING A RIFT THAT
LASTED FOR THE REST OF FRANKLIN'S LIFE.

LATER THAT YEAR, FRANKLIN AND TWO OTHERS WERE APPOINTED TO REPRESENT AMERICA IN FRANCE. FRANKLIN NEGOTIATED THE
FRANCO-AMERICAN ALLIANCE WHICH PROVIDED FOR MILITARY COOPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES AGAINST BRITAIN AND
ENSURED SIGNIFICANT FRENCH SUBSIDIES TO AMERICA. IN 1783, AS AMERICAN AMBASSADOR TO FRANCE, FRANKLIN SIGNED THE
TREATY OF PARIS, ENDING THE AMERICAN WAR OF INDEPENDENCE. HE WAS EXTREMELY POPULAR AND WELL KNOWN IN FRANCE, BUT IN
1785 RETURNED TO AMERICA. HE CONTINUED TO BE DEEPLY INVOLVED IN POLITICS, HELPING TO DRAFT THE CONSTITUTION.

FRANKLIN DIED IN PHILADELPHIA ON 17 APRIL 1790.

BILL COSBY WAS ONE OF AMERICA'S BEST-LOVED TV STARS, BUT HIS SON'S DEATH IN A DRIVE-BY SHOOTING AND COURT BATTLES
OVER ALLEGED SEXUAL ASSAULTS HAVE LEFT THE FAMILY MAN'S IMAGE IN TATTERS.

 

WILLIAM H. CosBy JR. FIRST TOOK TO THE STAGE AS A STAND-UP COMEDIAN WHILE AT COLLEGE. By HIS EARLY TWENTIES, HE HAD
APPEARED IN A NUMBER OF TELEVISION VARIETY PROGRAMMES INCLUDING ‘THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW’ AND “THE JOHNNY CARSON SHOW’.
HOWEVER, HIS BIG BREAK CAME IN 1965 WHEN HE APPEARED AS ALEXANDER SCOTT IN ‘I SPY, WINNING NUMEROUS EMMYS FOR HIS
PERFORMANCE.

IN 1969, HE STARRED IN HIS OWN SERIES, ‘THE BILL CosBy SHOW’. HE WAS ALSO ONE OF THE MAJOR CHARACTERS ON THE CHILDREN'S
TELEVISION SHOW ‘THE ELECTRIC COMPANY’ FOR ITS FIRST TWO SEASONS, AND CREATED THE HUMOROUS EDUCATIONAL CARTOON SERIES
‘Fat ALBERT AND THE Cossy KIDs’, ABOUT A GROUP OF YOUNG FRIENDS GROWING UP IN THE CITY. COSBY ALSO ACTED IN NUMEROUS FILMS,
ALTHOUGH NONE HAS RECEIVED THE ACCLAIM OF HIS TELEVISION WORK. IN 1984, ‘FaT ALBERT AND THE CosBy KIDs’ STOPPED
PRODUCTION, AND ‘THE COSBY SHOW’ COMMENCED. THIS PORTRAYAL OF A MIDDLE-CLASS AFRICAN-AMERICAN FAMILY — THE HUXTABLES -
WAS ORIGINALLY REJECTED BY ABC, ACCEPTED BY A THEN-FLOUNDERING NBC, AND BECAME AN ALMOST INSTANT SUCCESS. FROM 1985 TO
1987 THE SHOW BROKE VIEWING RECORDS, WITH COSBY BECOMING A REAL DRIVING FORCE IN US TELEVISION DURING THE 1980S.

‘THE COSBY SHOW’ FINALLY STOPPED PRODUCTION IN 1992, CONCEDING ITS DOMINANT POSITION TO THE CARTOON SERIES, ‘THE
SIMPSONS’. COSBY WAS ALSO DISSATISFIED WITH THE WAY ETHNIC MINORITIES WERE PORTRAYED ON TELEVISION. HE PRODUCED THE TV
SERIES ‘A DIFFERENT WORLD’ IN 1987, WHICH WAS SET IN A HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE AND CONCENTRATED ON YOUNG PEOPLE AND
EDUCATION.

 

THE LATE 1990S BROUGHT TROUBLE FOR COSBY, FIRST IN EARLY 1997 WITH THE DEATH OF HIS ONLY SON, ENNIS, WHO WAS SHOT TO

e isnot seeing, DEATH IN A RANDOM ACT OF VIOLENCE. ALSO THAT YEAR, HE WAS DRAGGED INTO A COURT CASE THAT INVOLVED A YOUNG WOMAN NAMED
cs AUTUMN JACKSON WHO CLAIMED THAT HE WAS HER BIOLOGICAL FATHER. COSBY ADMITTED TO AN AFFAIR WITH JACKSON'S MOTHER BUT

DENIED FATHERING JACKSON. SHE WAS CONVICTED OF EXTORTION AND SENTENCED TO 26 MONTHS IN PRISON.

 

 

COSBY HAS RECEIVED A NUMBER OF AWARDS DURING HIS CAREER AND IN OCTOBER 2009, THE COMEDIAN WAS PRESENTED WITH THE 12TH
ANNUAL MARK TWAIN PRIZE FOR AMERICAN HUMOUR.

A BOOK IS A SET OF WRITTEN, PRINTED, ILLUSTRATED, OR BLANK SHEETS, MADE OF INK, PAPER, PARCHMENT, OR OTHER
MATERIALS, USUALLY FASTENED TOGETHER TO HINGE AT ONE SIDE. A SINGLE SHEET WITHIN A BOOK IS CALLED A LEAF,
AND EACH SIDE OF A LEAF IS CALLED A PAGE. A BOOK PRODUCED IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT IS KNOWN AS AN ELECTRONIC
BOOK (E-BOOK).

BOOKS MAY ALSO REFER TO WORKS OF LITERATURE, OR A MAIN DIVISION OF SUCH A WORK. IN LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE,
A BOOK IS CALLED A MONOGRAPH, TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM SERIAL PERIODICALS SUCH AS MAGAZINES, JOURNALS OR NEWSPAPERS.
THE BODY OF ALL WRITTEN WORKS INCLUDING BOOKS IS LITERATURE. IN NOVELS AND SOMETIMES OTHER TYPES OF BOOKS (FOR
EXAMPLE, BIOGRAPHIES), A BOOK MAY BE DIVIDED INTO SEVERAL LARGE SECTIONS, ALSO CALLED BOOKS (BOOK 1, BOOK 2, BOOK 3,
AND SO ON). A LOVER OF BOOKS IS USUALLY REFERRED TO AS A BIBLIOPHILE OR, MORE INFORMALLY, A BOOKWORM — AN AVID
READER OF BOOKS.

A SHOP WHERE BOOKS ARE BOUGHT AND SOLD IS A BOOKSHOP OR BOOKSTORE. BOOKS CAN ALSO BE BORROWED FROM LIBRARIES.
GOOGLE HAS ESTIMATED THAT AS OF 2010, APPROXIMATELY 130,000,000 UNIQUE TITLES HAD BEEN PUBLISHED.

A BUSINESS (ALSO KNOWN AS ENTERPRISE OR FIRM) IS AN ORGANIZATION INVOLVED IN THE TRADE OF GOODS, SERVICES, OR
BOTH TO CONSUMERS. BUSINESSES ARE PREDOMINANT IN CAPITALIST ECONOMIES, WHERE MOST OF THEM ARE PRIVATELY OWNED AND
ADMINISTERED TO EARN PROFIT TO INCREASE THE WEALTH OF THEIR OWNERS. BUSINESSES MAY ALSO BE NOT-FOR-PROFIT OR
STATE-OWNED. A BUSINESS OWNED BY MULTIPLE INDIVIDUALS MAY BE REFERRED TO AS A COMPANY, ALTHOUGH THAT TERM ALSO HAS A
MORE PRECISE MEANING.

THE ETYMOLOGY OF "BUSINESS" RELATES TO THE STATE OF BEING BUSY EITHER AS AN INDIVIDUAL OR SOCIETY AS A WHOLE, DOING
COMMERCIALLY VIABLE AND PROFITABLE WORK. THE TERM "BUSINESS" HAS AT LEAST THREE USAGES, DEPENDING ON THE SCOPE — THE
SINGULAR USAGE TO MEAN A PARTICULAR ORGANIZATION; THE GENERALIZED USAGE TO REFER TO A PARTICULAR MARKET SECTOR,

"THE MUSIC BUSINESS" AND COMPOUND FORMS SUCH AS AGRIBUSINESS; AND THE BROADEST MEANING, WHICH ENCOMPASSES ALL
ACTIVITY BY THE COMMUNITY OF SUPPLIERS OF GOODS AND SERVICES. HOWEVER, THE EXACT DEFINITION OF BUSINESS, LIKE MUCH ELSE
IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF BUSINESS, IS A MATTER OF DEBATE AND COMPLEXITY OF MEANINGS.

THE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE OPERATION OF A BUSINESS, AND STUDY OF THIS SUBJECT, IS CALLED MANAGEMENT. THE MAJOR
BRANCHES OF MANAGEMENT ARE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, MARKETING MANAGEMENT, HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, STRATEGIC
MANAGEMENT, PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT, OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT, SERVICE MANAGEMENT AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
MANAGEMENT.

OWNERS ENGAGE IN BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH THE EMPLOYMENT OF MANAGERS. OWNER
MANAGERS, OR HIRED MANAGERS ADMINISTER TO THREE COMPONENT RESOURCES THAT CONSTITUTE THE BUSINESS’ VALUE OR WORTH:
FINANCIAL RESOURCES, CAPITAL OR TANGIBLE RESOURCES, AND HUMAN RESOURCES. THESE RESOURCES ARE ADMINISTERED TO IN AT
LEAST FIVE FUNCTIONAL AREAS: LEGAL CONTRACTING, MANUFACTURING OR SERVICE PRODUCTION, MARKETING, ACCOUNTING,
FINANCING, AND HUMAN RESOURCING.

CONFUCIUS (BORN KONG QIU, STYLED ZHONG NI) was BORN IN THE VILLAGE OF ZOU IN THE COUNTRY OF LU IN 551 B.C., A
POOR DESCENDANT OF A DEPOSED NOBLE FAMILY. AS A CHILD, HE HELD MAKE-BELIEVE TEMPLE RITUALS; AS A YOUNG ADULT, HE QUICKLY
EARNED A REPUTATION FOR FAIRNESS, POLITENESS AND LOVE OF LEARNING, AND HE WAS REPUTED TO BE QUITE TALL. HE TRAVELED
EXTENSIVELY AND STUDIED AT THE IMPERIAL CAPITAL, ZHOU, WHERE HE IS SAID TO HAVE MET AND SPOKE WITH LAO ZI, THE FOUNDER OF
DAOISM.

UPON HIS RETURN TO LU, HE GAINED RENOWN AS A TEACHER, BUT WHEN HE WAS 35, DUKE ZHAO OF LU LED HIS COUNTRY TO WAR, WAS
ROUTED AND FLED TO THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRY OF QI; IN THE DISORDER FOLLOWING THE BATTLE, CONFUCIUS FOLLOWED. DUKE
ZHAO FREQUENTLY CAME TO HIM FOR ADVICE, BUT UPON COUNSEL OF ONE OF HIS MINISTERS, HE DECIDED AGAINST GRANTING LAND TO
CONFUCIUS AND GRADUALLY STOPPED SEEKING HIS COUNSEL. WHEN OTHER NOBLES BEGAN PLOTTING AGAINST CONFUCIUS’ POSITION,
DUKE ZHAO REFUSED TO INTERVENE, AND CONFUCIUS RETURNED TO LU. BUT CONDITIONS THERE WERE NO BETTER THAN BEFORE, AND
CONFUCIUS RETIRED FROM PUBLIC LIFE TO CONCENTRATE ON TEACHING AND STUDYING.

AT AGE 50, HE WAS APPROACHED BY THE BARON OF QI TO HELP DEFEND AGAINST A REBELLION, BUT HE DECLINED. HE WAS LATER MADE
A CITY MAGISTRATE BY THE NEW DUKE OF LU, AND UNDER HIS ADMINISTRATION THE CITY FLOURISHED; HE WAS PROMOTED SEVERAL
TIMES, EVENTUALLY BECOMING GRAND SECRETARY OF JUSTICE AND, AT AGE 56, CHIEF MINISTER OF LU. NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES
BEGAN TO WORRY THAT LU WOULD BECOME TOO POWERFUL, AND THEY SENT MESSENGERS WITH GIFTS AND DANCERS TO DISTRACT THE
DUKE DURING A SACRIFICE HOLIDAY. WHEN THE DUKE ABANDONED HIS DUTIES TO RECEIVE THE MESSENGERS, CONFUCIUS RESIGNED AND
LEFT THE COUNTRY.

CONFUCIUS SPENT THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WANDERING CHINA WITH HIS DISCIPLES, FINDING THAT HIS PRESENCE AT ROYAL COURTS WAS
RARELY TOLERATED FOR LONG BEFORE NOBLES WOULD BEGIN PLOTTING TO DRIVE HIM OUT OR HAVE HIM KILLED. HE WAS ARRESTED
ONCE AND JAILED FOR FIVE DAYS, AND AT 62 HE WAS PURSUED, ALONG WITH HIS DISCIPLES, INTO THE COUNTRYSIDE BY A BAND OF
SOLDIERS SENT BY JEALOUS NOBLES, UNTIL HE WAS ABLE TO SEND A MESSENGER TO THE SYMPATHETIC KING OF A NEARBY COUNTRY,

’ WHO SENT HIS OWN SOLDIERS TO RESCUE THEM. ONCE AGAIN, CONFUCIUS WAS TO BE GIVEN LAND BUT WAS DENIED IT UPON COUNSEL OF

ANOTHER HIGH MINISTER. AFTER FURTHER WANDERINGS, HE EVENTUALLY RETURNED TO LU AT AGE 67. ALTHOUGH HE WAS WELCOMED
THERE AND CHOSE TO REMAIN, HE WAS NOT OFFERED PUBLIC OFFICE AGAIN, NOR DID HE SEEK IT. INSTEAD HE SPENT THE REST OF HIS
YEARS TEACHING AND, FINALLY, WRITING. HE DIED AT 72.

By three methods we may learn wisdom: First, are ich is noblest; Second
imitation, which is easiest; and third by experience, which is the bitterest.
Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it.

Only the wisest and stupidest of men never change.

Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.

No matter how busy you may think you are, you must find time for reading, or
surrender yourself to self-chosen ignorance.

Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.

It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.

Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves.

What the superior man seeks is in himself; what the small man seeks is in others.
The man who asks a question is a fool for a minute, the man who does not ask is a
fool for life.

Attack the evil that is within yourself, rather than attacking the evil that is in others.
The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor man perfected without trials.

When you see a good person, think of becoming like her/him. When you see someone
not so good, reflect on your own weak points.

Dont complain about the snow on your neighbor's roof when your own doorstep

is unclean.

The beginning of wisdom is to call things by their proper name.

RULE MOST OF THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT. CHANAKYA SERVED AS THE CHIEF ADVISOR TO BOTH CHANDRAGUPTA AND HIS SON
BINDUSARA.

CHANARKYA IS TRADITIONALLY IDENTIFIED AS KAUTILYA OR VISHNU GUPTA, WHO AUTHORED THE ANCIENT INDIAN POLITICAL TREATISE
CALLED ARTHASASTRA. AS SUCH, HE IS CONSIDERED AS THE PIONEER OF THE FIELD OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE IN INDIA, AND
HIS WORK IS THOUGHT OF AS AN IMPORTANT PRECURSOR TO CLASSICAL ECONOMICS. CHANAKYA IS OFTEN CALLED THE "INDIAN
MACHIAVELLI", ALTHOUGH HIS WORKS PREDATE MACHIAVELLI'S BY ABOUT 1,800 YEARS.HIS WORKS WERE LOST NEAR THE END OF THE
GUPTA DYNASTY AND NOT REDISCOVERED UNTIL 1915.

CHANAKYA’S BIRTHPLACE IS A MATTER OF CONTROVERSY, AND THERE ARE MULTIPLE THEORIES ABOUT HIS ORIGIN.

ACCORDING TO ONE THEORY, HE WAS BORN IN PATALIPUTRA OR A TOWN NEAR IT, KUSUMPUR. ACCORDING TO THE BUDDHIST TEXT
MAHAVAMSA TIKA, HIS BIRTHPLACE WAS TAXILA. THE JAIN SCRIPTURES, SUCH AS ADBIDHANA CHINTAMANI, MENTION HIM AS A DRAMILA,
IMPLYING THAT HE WAS A NATIVE OF SOUTH INDIA. ACCORDING TO SOME OTHER JAIN ACCOUNTS SUCH AS HEMACHANDRA’S
PARISHISHTAPARVA, CHANAKYA WAS BORN IN THE CANAKA VILLAGE OF THE GOLLA REGION, TO A JAIN BRAHMIN NAMED CANIN AND HIS
WIFE CANESVARI. OTHER SOURCES MENTION HIS FATHER’S NAME AS CHANAK AND STATE THAT CHANAKAYA’S NAME DERIVES FROM HIS

bb FATHER’S NAME.

A person should not be too honest. Straight trees are cut first and Honest people are screwed first.

Before you start some work, always ask yourself three questions - Why am I doing it, What the
results might be and Will I be successful. Only when you think deeply and find satisfactory
answers to these questions, go ahead.

A good wife is one who serves her husband in the morning like a mother does, loves

him in the day like a sister does and pleases him like a prostitute in the night.

There is some self-interest behind every friendship. There is no Friendship without
self-interests. This is a bitter truth.

God is not present in idols. Your feelings are your god. The soul is your temple.
Education is the Best Friend. An Educated Person is Respected Everywhere.
Education beats the Beauty and the Youth.

The serpent, the king, the tiger, the stinging wasp, the small child, the dog owned by
other people, and the fool: these seven ought not to be awakened from sleep.

O wise man! Give your wealth only to the worthy and never to others. The water o
the sea received by the clouds is always sweet.

Even if a snake is not poisonous, it should pretend to be venomous.

 

 

 
 Never make friends with people who are above or below you in status. Such friendships will
never give you any happiness.

Books are as useful to a stupid person as a mirror is useful to a blind person.

Test a servant while in the discharge of his duty, a relative in difficulty, a friend in adversity, and
a wife in misfortune.

The life of an uneducated man is as useless as the tail of a dog which neither covers its

rear end, nor protects it from the bites of insects.

One whose knowledge is confined to books and whose wealth is in the possession of
others, can use neither his knowledge nor wealth when the need for them arises.

As a single withered tree, if set aflame, causes a whole forest to burn, so does a rascal
son destroy a whole family.

There is poison in the fang of the serpent, in the mouth of the fly and in the sting of a
scorpion; but the wicked man is saturated with it.

He whose son is obedient to him, whose wife's conduct is in accordance with his
wishes, and who is content with his riches has his heaven here on earth.

Avoid him who talks sweetly before you but tries to ruin you behind your back, for he
is like a pitcher full of poison with milk on top.

As water collected in a tank gets pure by filtration, so accumulated wealth is preserved
by being employed in charity.

Time perfects men as well as destroys them.

 

 

 
 It is better to have only one son endowed with good qualities than a hundred devoid of them.
For the moon though one, dispels the darkness, which the stars, though numerous, do not.
A wicked wife, a false friend, a saucy servant and living in a house with a serpent in it are nothing

but death.
Do not put your trust in rivers, men who carry weapons, beasts with claws or horns, women, and

members of a royal family.
Those parents who do not educate their sons are their enemies; for as is a crane among

swans, so are ignorant sons in a public assembly.
‘Trees on a riverbank, a woman in another man’s house, and kings without counselors

go without doubt to swift destruction.
Lakshmi, the Goddess of wealth, comes of Her own accord where fools are not

respected, grain is well stored up, and the husband and wife do not quarrel.

The Goddess of wealth is unsteady, and so is the life breath. The duration of life is
uncertain, and the place of habitation is uncertain; but in all this inconsistent world

religious merit alone is immovable.
A father who is a chronic debtor, an adulterous mother, a beautiful wife, and

unlearned son are enemies in one's own home.
Do not pass between two brahmanas, between a brahmana and his sacrificial

between a wife and her husband, a master and his servant, and a plough and an ox.
Beauty is spoiled by an immoral nature; noble birth by bad conduct; learning,
without being perfected; and wealth by not being properly utilised.

There are three gems upon this earth; food, water, and pleasing words --
pieces of rocks as gems.

CHARLES DARWIN WAS A BRITISH SCIENTIST WHO LAID THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION AND
TRANSFORMED THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT THE NATURAL WORLD.

CHARLES ROBERT DARWIN WAS BORN ON 12 FEBRUARY 1809 IN SHREWSBURY, SHROPSHIRE INTO A WEALTHY AND WELL-CONNECTED
FAMILY. HIS MATERNAL GRANDFATHER WAS CHINA MANUFACTURER JOSIAH WEDGWOOD, WHILE HIS PATERNAL GRANDFATHER WAS
ERASMUS DARWIN, ONE OF THE LEADING INTELLECTUALS OF 18TH CENTURY ENGLAND.

DARWIN HIMSELF INITIALLY PLANNED TO FOLLOW A MEDICAL CAREER, AND STUDIED AT EDINBURGH UNIVERSITY BUT LATER SWITCHED
TO DIVINITY AT CAMBRIDGE. IN 1831, HE JOINED A FIVE YEAR SCIENTIFIC EXPEDITION ON THE SURVEY SHIP HMS BEAGLE.

AT THIS TIME, MOST EUROPEANS BELIEVED THAT THE WORLD WAS CREATED BY GOD IN SEVEN DAYS AS DESCRIBED IN THE BIBLE. ON THE
VOYAGE, DARWIN READ LYELL'S 'PRINCIPLES OF GEOLOGY' WHICH SUGGESTED THAT THE FOSSILS FOUND IN ROCKS WERE ACTUALLY
EVIDENCE OF ANIMALS THAT HAD LIVED MANY THOUSANDS OR MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO. LYELL'S ARGUMENT WAS REINFORCED IN
DARWIN'S OWN MIND BY THE RICH VARIETY OF ANIMAL LIFE AND THE GEOLOGICAL FEATURES HE SAW DURING HIS VOYAGE. THE
BREAKTHROUGH IN HIS IDEAS CAME IN THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS, 500 MILES WEST OF SOUTH AMERICA. DARWIN NOTICED THAT EACH
ISLAND SUPPORTED ITS OWN FORM OF FINCH WHICH WERE CLOSELY RELATED BUT DIFFERED IN IMPORTANT WAYS.

ON HIS RETURN TO ENGLAND IN 1836, DARWIN TRIED TO SOLVE THE RIDDLES OF THESE OBSERVATIONS AND THE PUZZLE OF HOW SPECIES
EVOLVE. INFLUENCED BY THE IDEAS OF MALTHUS, HE PROPOSED A THEORY OF EVOLUTION OCCURRING BY THE PROCESS OF NATURAL
SELECTION. THE ANIMALS (OR PLANTS) BEST SUITED TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT ARE MORE LIKELY TO SURVIVE AND REPRODUCE, PASSING
ON THE CHARACTERISTICS WHICH HELPED THEM SURVIVE TO THEIR OFFSPRING. GRADUALLY, THE SPECIES CHANGES OVER TIME.

DARWIN WORKED ON HIS THEORY FOR 20 YEARS. AFTER LEARNING THAT ANOTHER NATURALIST, ALFRED RUSSEL WALLACE, HAD
DEVELOPED SIMILAR IDEAS, THE TWO MADE A JOINT ANNOUNCEMENT OF THEIR DISCOVERY IN 1858. IN 1859 DARWIN PUBLISHED
‘ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES BY MEANS OF NATURAL SELECTION".

THE BOOK WAS EXTREMELY CONTROVERSIAL, BECAUSE THE LOGICAL EXTENSION OF DARWIN'S THEORY WAS THAT HOMO SAPIENS WAS
SIMPLY ANOTHER FORM OF ANIMAL. IT MADE IT SEEM POSSIBLE THAT EVEN PEOPLE MIGHT JUST HAVE EVOLVED - QUITE POSSIBLY FROM
APES - AND DESTROYED THE PREVAILING ORTHODOXY ON HOW THE WORLD WAS CREATED. DARWIN WAS VEHEMENTLY ATTACKED,
PARTICULARLY BY THE CHURCH. HOWEVER, HIS IDEAS SOON GAINED CURRENCY AND HAVE BECOME THE NEW ORTHODOXY.

DARWIN DIED ON 19 APRIL 1882 AND WAS BURIED IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY.

The highest possible stage in moral culture is when we recognise that we ought to

position of being a science founded on an improved theory, is it then a science or faith?
Even in the worm that crawls in the earth there glows a divine spark. en you

Besides love and sympathy, animals exhibit other qualities connected wi i

CHARLES DICKENS Is MUCH LOVED FOR HIS GREAT CONTRIBUTION TO CLASSIC ENGLISH LITERATURE. HE WAS THE

QUINTESSENTIAL VICTORIAN AUTHOR. HIS EPIC STORIES, VIVID CHARACTERS AND EXHAUSTIVE DEPICTION OF
CONTEMPORARY LIFE ARE UNFORGETTABLE.

 

 

HIS OWN STORY IS ONE OF RAGS TO RICHES. HE WAS BORN IN PORTSMOUTH ON 7 FEBRUARY 1812, TO JOHN AND ELIZABETH DICKENS.
THE GOOD FORTUNE OF BEING SENT TO SCHOOL AT THE AGE OF NINE WAS SHORT-LIVED BECAUSE HIS FATHER, INSPIRATION FOR THE
CHARACTER OF MR MICAWBER IN 'DAVID COPPERFIELD’, WAS IMPRISONED FOR BAD DEBT. THE ENTIRE FAMILY, APART FROM CHARLES,
WERE SENT TO MARSHALSEA ALONG WITH THEIR PATRIARCH. CHARLES WAS SENT TO WORK IN WARREN'S BLACKING FACTORY AND
ENDURED APPALLING CONDITIONS AS WELL AS LONELINESS AND DESPAIR. AFTER THREE YEARS HE WAS RETURNED TO SCHOOL, BUT THE
EXPERIENCE WAS NEVER FORGOTTEN AND BECAME FICTIONALISED IN TWO OF HIS BETTER-KNOWN NOVELS 'DAVID COPPERFIELD’ AND
'GREAT EXPECTATIONS’.

LIKE MANY OTHERS, HE BEGAN HIS LITERARY CAREER AS A JOURNALIST. HIS OWN FATHER BECAME A REPORTER AND CHARLES BEGAN
WITH THE JOURNALS 'THE MIRROR OF PARLIAMENT’ AND ‘THE TRUE SUN’. THEN IN 1833 HE BECAME PARLIAMENTARY JOURNALIST FOR
THE MORNING CHRONICLE. WITH NEW CONTACTS IN THE PRESS HE WAS ABLE TO PUBLISH A SERIES OF SKETCHES UNDER THE
PSEUDONYM ‘Boz’. IN APRIL 1836, HE MARRIED CATHERINE HOGARTH, DAUGHTER OF GEORGE HOGARTH WHO EDITED 'SKETCHES BY
Boz'. WITHIN THE SAME MONTH CAME THE PUBLICATION OF THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL ‘PICKWICK PAPERS’, AND FROM THAT POINT ON
THERE WAS NO LOOKING BACK FOR DICKENS.

AS WELL AS A HUGE LIST OF NOVELS HE PUBLISHED AUTOBIOGRAPHY, EDITED WEEKLY PERIODICALS INCLUDING 'HOUSEHOLD WoRDs'
AND 'ALL YEAR ROUND’, WROTE TRAVEL BOOKS AND ADMINISTERED CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS. HE WAS ALSO A THEATRE
ENTHUSIAST, WROTE PLAYS AND PERFORMED BEFORE QUEEN VICTORIA IN 1851. HIS ENERGY WAS INEXHAUSTIBLE AND HE SPENT MUCH
TIME ABROAD - FOR EXAMPLE LECTURING AGAINST SLAVERY IN THE UNITED STATES AND TOURING ITALY WITH COMPANIONS AUGUSTUS
EGG AND WILKIE COLLINS, A CONTEMPORARY WRITER WHO INSPIRED DICKENS’ FINAL UNFINISHED NOVEL "THE MYSTERY OF EDWIN
Droop’.

HE WAS ESTRANGED FROM HIS WIFE IN 1858 AFTER THE BIRTH OF THEIR TEN CHILDREN, BUT MAINTAINED RELATIONS WITH HIS
MISTRESS, THE ACTRESS ELLEN TERNAN. HE DIED OF A STROKE IN 1870. HE IS BURIED AT WESTMINSTER ABBEY.

ON APRIL 16, 1889, HOLLYWOOD LEGEND CHARLIE CHAPLIN WAS BORN IN LONDON, ENGLAND.

CHAPLIN, ONE OF THE MOST FINANCIALLY SUCCESSFUL STARS OF EARLY HOLLYWOOD, WAS INTRODUCED TO THE STAGE WHEN HE WAS
FIVE. THE SON OF LONDON MUSIC HALL ENTERTAINERS, YOUNG CHAPLIN WAS WATCHING A SHOW STARRING HIS MOTHER WHEN HER
VOICE CRACKED. HE WAS QUICKLY SHUFFLED ONTO THE STAGE TO FINISH THE ACT.

CHAPLIN’S FATHER DIED WHEN CHAPLIN WAS A TODDLER, AND WHEN HIS MOTHER HAD A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN CHAPLIN AND HIS
OLDER HALF-BROTHER, SYDNEY, ROAMED LONDON, WHERE THEY DANCED ON THE STREETS AND COLLECTED PENNIES IN A HAT. THEY
EVENTUALLY WENT TO AN ORPHANAGE AND JOINED THE EIGHT LANCASHIRE LADS, A CHILDREN’S DANCE TROUPE. WHEN CHAPLIN WAS
17, HE DEVELOPED HIS COMEDIC SKILLS WITH THE HELP OF FRED KARNO’S COMPANY, FOR WHICH HIS HALF-BROTHER HAD ALREADY
BECOME A POPULAR COMEDIAN. SOON, CHAPLIN’S BOWLER HAT, OUT-TURNED FEET, MUSTACHE AND WALKING CANE BECAME HIS
TRADEMARK. HE JOINED THE KEYSTONE COMPANY AND FILMED MAKING A LIVING, IN WHICH HE PLAYED A MUSTACHIOED VILLAIN WHO
WORE A MONOCLE. IT WASN’T LONG BEFORE HE ALSO WORKED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CAMERA, HELPING DIRECT HIS 12TH FILM AND
DIRECTING HIS 13TH, CAUGHT IN THE RAIN, ON HIS OWN.

CHAPLIN REFINED WHAT WOULD SOON BECOME HIS LEGACY, THE CHARACTER CHARLIE THE TRAMP, AND SIGNED ON WITH THE ESSANAY
COMPANY IN 1915 FOR $1,250 A WEEK, PLUS A $10,000 BONUS--QUITE A JUMP FROM THE $175 THAT KEYSTONE PAID HIM. THE NEXT
YEAR, HE SIGNED WITH MUTUAL FOR $10,000 A WEEK, PLUS A $150,000 BONUS UNDER A CONTRACT THAT REQUIRED HIM TO MAKE 12
FILMS ANNUALLY BUT GRANTED HIM COMPLETE CREATIVE CONTROL OVER THE PICTURES. AND IN 1918, HE SIGNED A CONTRACT WITH
FirsT NATIONAL FOR $1 MILLION FOR EIGHT FILMS. A MASTERFUL SILENT FILM ACTOR AND PANTOMIMIST WHO COULD ELICIT BOTH
LAUGHTER AND TEARS FROM HIS AUDIENCES, CHAPLIN RESISTED THE ARRIVAL OF SOUND IN MOVIES. INDEED, IN HIS FIRST FILM THAT
FEATURED SOUND (CITY LIGHTS IN 1931), HE ONLY USED MUSIC. HIS FIRST TRUE SOUND FILM WAS 1940’S THE GREAT DICTATOR, IN
WHICH HE MOCKED FASCISM.

CHAPLIN FOUNDED UNITED ARTISTS CORPORATION IN 1919 WITH MARY PICKFORD, DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS AND DIRECTOR D.W.
GRIFFITH. CHAPLIN MARRIED TWICE MORE, BOTH TIMES TO TEENAGE GIRLS. HIS FOURTH WIFE, OONA O’NEILL, WHO WAS 18 WHEN SHE
MARRIED THE 54-YEAR-OLD ACTOR, WAS THE DAUGHTER OF PLAYWRIGHT EUGENE O’NEILL. THOUGH HE HAD LIVED IN THE UNITED
STATES FOR 42 YEARS, CHAPLIN NEVER BECAME A U.S. CITIZEN. A VOCAL PACIFIST, CHAPLIN WAS ACCUSED OF COMMUNIST TIES, WHICH
HE DENIED. NEVERTHELESS, IN 1952, IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS PREVENTED CHAPLIN AND HIS WIFE FROM RE-ENTERING THE UNITED
STATES AFTER A FOREIGN TOUR. THE COUPLE DID NOT RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES FOR 20 YEARS; INSTEAD THEY SETTLED IN
SWITZERLAND WITH THEIR EIGHT CHILDREN. CHAPLIN RETURNED TO AMERICA 1972 TO ACCEPT A SPECIAL ACADEMY AWARD FOR “THE
INCALCULABLE EFFECT HE HAS HAD ON MAKING MOTION PICTURES THE ART FOR AND OF THIS CENTURY.” HE WAS KNIGHTED

SIR CHARLES SPENCER CHAPLIN IN 1975. HE DIED TWO YEARS LATER.

A DREAM OR A GOAL IS A DESIRED RESULT A SYSTEM ENVISIONS, PLANS AND COMMITS TO ACHIEVE—A PERSONAL OR ORGANIZATION-
AL DESIRED END-POINT IN SOME SORT OF ASSUMED DEVELOPMENT. MANY PEOPLE ENDEAVOR TO REACH GOALS WITHIN A FINITE TIME
BY SETTING DEADLINES.

IT Is ROUGHLY SIMILAR TO PURPOSE OR AIM, THE ANTICIPATED RESULT WHICH GUIDES REACTION, OR AN END, WHICH IS AN OBJECT,
EITHER A PHYSICAL OBJECT OR AN ABSTRACT OBJECT, THAT HAS INTRINSIC VALUE.

GOAL-SETTING IDEALLY INVOLVES ESTABLISHING SPECIFIC, MEASURABLE, ATTAINABLE, REALISTIC AND TIME-TARGETED OBJECTIVES.
WORK ON THE GOAL-SETTING THEORY SUGGESTS THAT IT CAN SERVE AS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR MAKING PROGRESS BY ENSURING THAT
PARTICIPANTS HAVE A CLEAR AWARENESS OF WHAT THEY MUST DO TO ACHIEVE OR HELP ACHIEVE AN OBJECTIVE. ON A PERSONAL LEVEL,
THE PROCESS OF SETTING GOALS ALLOWS PEOPLE TO SPECIFY AND THEN WORK TOWARDS THEIR OWN OBJECTIVES — MOST COMMONLY
FINANCIAL OR CAREER-BASED GOALS. GOAL-SETTING COMPRISES A MAJOR COMPONENT OF PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT. A GOAL CAN BE
LONG-TERM OR SHORT-TERM.

ACHIEVING COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT GOALS REQUIRES FOCUS, LONG-TERM DILIGENCE AND EFFORT. SUCCESS IN ANY FIELD REQUIRES
FORGOING EXCUSES AND JUSTIFICATIONS FOR POOR PERFORMANCE OR LACK OF ADEQUATE PLANNING; IN SHORT, SUCCESS REQUIRES
EMOTIONAL MATURITY. THE MEASURE OF BELIEF THAT PEOPLE HAVE IN THEIR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE A PERSONAL GOAL ALSO AFFECTS
THAT ACHIEVEMENT.

LONG TERM ACHIEVEMENTS RELY ON SHORT-TERM ACHIEVEMENTS. EMOTIONAL CONTROL OVER THE SMALL MOMENTS OF THE SINGLE
DAY MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE LONG TERM.

ERNEST HEMINGWAY (1899-1961), BORN IN OAK PaRK, ILLINOIS, STARTED HIS CAREER AS A WRITER IN A NEWSPAPER OFFICE IN KANSAS
CITY AT THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN. AFTER THE UNITED STATES ENTERED THE FIRST WORLD WAR, HE JOINED A VOLUNTEER AMBULANCE UNIT IN
THE ITALIAN ARMY. SERVING AT THE FRONT, HE WAS WOUNDED, WAS DECORATED BY THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT, AND SPENT CONSIDERABLE
TIME IN HOSPITALS. AFTER HIS RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES, HE BECAME A REPORTER FOR CANADIAN AND AMERICAN NEWSPAPERS AND
WAS SOON SENT BACK TO EUROPE TO COVER SUCH EVENTS AS THE GREEK REVOLUTION.

DURING THE TWENTIES, HEMINGWAY BECAME A MEMBER OF THE GROUP OF EXPATRIATE AMERICANS IN PARIS, WHICH HE DESCRIBED IN HIS
FIRST IMPORTANT WORK, THE SUN ALSO RISES (1926). EQUALLY SUCCESSFUL WAS A FAREWELL TO ARMS (1929), THE STUDY OF AN AMERICAN
AMBULANCE OFFICER'S DISILLUSIONMENT IN THE WAR AND HIS ROLE AS A DESERTER. HEMINGWAY USED HIS EXPERIENCES AS A REPORTER
DURING THE CIVIL WAR IN SPAIN AS THE BACKGROUND FOR HIS MOST AMBITIOUS NOVEL, FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS (1940). AMONG HIS
LATER WORKS, THE MOST OUTSTANDING IS THE SHORT NOVEL, THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA (1952), THE STORY OF AN OLD FISHERMAN'S
JOURNEY, HIS LONG AND LONELY STRUGGLE WITH A FISH AND THE SEA, AND HIS VICTORY IN DEFEAT.

HEMINGWAY - HIMSELF A GREAT SPORTSMAN - LIKED TO PORTRAY SOLDIERS, HUNTERS, BULLFIGHTERS - TOUGH, AT TIMES PRIMITIVE PEOPLE
WHOSE COURAGE AND HONESTY ARE SET AGAINST THE BRUTAL WAYS OF MODERN SOCIETY, AND WHO IN THIS CONFRONTATION LOSE HOPE AND
FAITH. HIS STRAIGHTFORWARD PROSE, HIS SPARE DIALOGUE, AND HIS PREDILECTION FOR UNDERSTATEMENT ARE PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE IN
HIS SHORT STORIES, SOME OF WHICH ARE COLLECTED IN MEN WITHOUT WOMEN (1927) AND THE FIFTH COLUMN AND THE First FORTY-NINE
STORIES (1938).

ERNESTO CHE GUEVARA WAS AN ARGENTINEAN-BORN, CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY LEADER WHO BECAME A LEFT-WING HERO.
A PHOTOGRAPH OF HIM BY ALBERTO KORDA BECAME AN ICONIC IMAGE OF THE 20TH CENTURY.

ERNESTO GUEVARA DE LA SERNA, KNOWN AS CHE GUEVARA, WAS BORN ON 14 JUNE 1928 IN ROSARIO, ARGENTINA INTO A MIDDLE-CLASS
FAMILY. HE STUDIED MEDICINE AT BUENOS AIRES UNIVERSITY AND DURING THIS TIME TRAVELLED WIDELY IN SOUTH AND CENTRAL AMERICA.
THE WIDESPREAD POVERTY AND OPPRESSION HE WITNESSED, FUSED WITH HIS INTEREST IN MARXISM, CONVINCED HIM THAT THE ONLY
SOLUTION TO SOUTH AND CENTRAL AMERICA'S PROBLEMS WAS ARMED REVOLUTION.

IN 1954 HE WENT TO MEXICO AND THE FOLLOWING YEAR HE MET CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY LEADER FIDEL CASTRO. GUEVARA JOINED CASTRO'S
‘26TH JULY MOVEMENT’ AND PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN THE EVENTUAL SUCCESS OF ITS GUERRILLA WAR AGAINST CUBAN DICTATOR FULGENCIO
BATISTA.

CASTRO OVERTHREW BATISTA IN 1959 AND TOOK POWER IN CUBA. FROM 1959-1961, GUEVARA WAS PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL BANK OF
CUBA, AND THEN MINISTER OF INDUSTRY. IN THIS POSITION, HE TRAVELLED THE WORLD AS AN AMBASSADOR FOR CUBA. AT HOME, HE
CARRIED OUT PLANS FOR LAND REDISTRIBUTION AND THE NATIONALISATION OF INDUSTRY.

A STRONG OPPONENT OF THE UNITED STATES, HE GUIDED THE CASTRO REGIME TOWARDS ALIGNMENT WITH THE SOVIET UNION. THE CUBAN
ECONOMY FALTERED AS A RESULT OF AMERICAN TRADE SANCTIONS AND UNSUCCESSFUL REFORMS. DURING THIS DIFFICULT TIME GUEVARA
BEGAN TO FALL OUT WITH THE OTHER CUBAN LEADERS. HE LATER EXPRESSED HIS DESIRE TO SPREAD REVOLUTION IN OTHER PARTS OF THE
DEVELOPING WORLD, AND IN 1965 CASTRO ANNOUNCED THAT GUEVARA HAD LEFT CUBA.

GUEVARA THEN SPENT SEVERAL MONTHS IN AFRICA, PARTICULARLY THE CONGO, ATTEMPTING TO TRAIN REBEL FORCES IN GUERRILLA

FYODOR MIKHAILOVICH DOSTOEVSKY WAS BORN OCTOBER 30, 1821, IN Moscow's HOSPITAL FOR THE Poor. HE WAS THE SECOND OF
SEVEN CHILDREN BORN TO A FORMER ARMY SURGEON, WHO WAS MURDERED IN 1839 WHEN HIS OWN SERFS POURED VODKA DOWN HIS THROAT
UNTIL HE DIED.

FOLLOWING A BOARDING SCHOOL EDUCATION IN MOSCOW WITH HIS OLDER BROTHER MIKHAIL, FYODOR WAS ADMITTED TO THE ACADEMY OF
MILITARY ENGINEERS IN ST. PETERSBURG IN 1838. HE COMPLETED HIS STUDIES IN 1843, GRADUATING AS A LIEUTENANT, BUT WAS QUICKLY
CONVINCED THAT HE PREFERRED A CAREER IN WRITING TO BEING MIRED IN THE BUREAUCRATIC RUSSIAN MILITARY. IN 1844 HE PUBLISHED A
TRANSLATION OF BALZAc's EUGENIE GRANDET, AND HE FOLLOWED THIS TWO YEARS LATER WITH HIS FIRST ORIGINAL PUBLISHED WORK, POOR
FOLK, A WIDELY-ACCLAIMED SHORT NOVEL CHAMPIONED BY THE INFLUENTIAL CRITIC VISSARION BELINSKY.

ON APRIL 23, 1849, DOSTOEVSKY WAS ARRESTED WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PETRASHEVSKY CIRCLE AND WAS SENTENCED TO DEATH TO
WORK AS MATERIALIST ATHEISM. HE WAS PLACED IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT IN THE PETROPAVLOVSKY FORTRESS FOR EIGHT MONTHS. DURING
THIS TIME, TSAR NIKOLAI I CHANGED HIS SENTENCE BUT ORDERED THAT THIS CHANGE ONLY BE ANNOUNCED AT THE LAST MINUTE. ON
DECEMBER 22, DOSTOEVSKY AND HIS FELLOW PRISONERS WERE LED THROUGH ALL THE INITIAL STEPS OF EXECUTION, AND SEVERAL OF THEM
WERE ALREADY TIED TO POSTS AWAITING THEIR DEATHS WHEN THE REPRIEVE WAS SOUNDED.

DOSTOEVSKY’S HARROWING NEAR-EXECUTION AND HIS TERRIBLE YEARS OF IMPRISONMENT MADE AN INDELIBLE IMPRESSION ON
HIM,CONVERTING HIM TO A LIFELONG INTENSE SPIRITUALITY. THESE BELIEFS FORMED THE BASIS FOR HIS GREAT NOVELS.

TIME PASSED, AND DOSTOEVSKY, PREOCCUPIED WITH A LONGER, SERIALIZED NOVEL, DID NO WORK ON THE BOOK HE HAD PROMISED
STELLOVSKY UNTIL AT LAST, ON THE ADVICE OF FRIENDS, HE HIRED THE YOUNG ANNA GRIGORIEVNA SNITKIN AS HIS STENOGRAPHER. HE
DICTATED THE GAMBLER TO HER, AND THE MANUSCRIPT WAS DELIVERED TO STELLOVSKY ON THE VERY DAY THEIR AGREEMENT WAS TO EXPIRE.
THROUGH NOVEMBER, DOSTOEVSKY COMPLETED THE LONGER NOVEL CRIME AND PUNISHMENT, WHICH WAS PUBLISHED THAT YEAR TO
IMMEDIATE AND ABUNDANT SUCCESS. FYODOR PROPOSED TO ANNA, AND THEY SOON WERE WED ON FEBRUARY 15, 1867.

FYODOR DOSTOEVSKY DIED ON JANUARY 28, 1881, OF COMPLICATIONS RELATED TO HIS EPILEPSY. AT THE FUNERAL PROCESSION IN ST.
PETERSBURG, HIS COFFIN WAS FOLLOWED BY THIRTY TO FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. HIS EPITAPH READS, “VERILY, VERILY, I say UNTO YOU,
EXCEPT A CORN OF WHEAT FALL INTO THE GROUND AND DIE, IT ABIDETH ALONE: BUT IF IT DIE, IT BRINGETH FORTH MUCH FRUIT.” WHICH IS THE
QUOTATION DOSTOEVSKY CHOSE FOR THE PREFACE OF THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV.

 

DOSTOEVSKY IS ONE OF THE FIRST WRITERS TO EXPLORE THE IDEAS OF PSYCHOANALYSIS IN HIS WORKS. HIS RELIGIOUS IDEAS ARE STILL
RELEVANT IN THEOLOGICAL DEBATE. HE ALSO IS ONE OF THE SEMINAL CREATORS OF THE IDEAS OF EXISTENTIALISM. DESPITE HIS VARYING
SUCCESS DURING HIS LIFETIME, TODAY DOSTOEVSKY IS CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE PREEMINENT RUSSIAN NOVELISTS—INDEED, ONE OF THE
PREEMINENT NOVELISTS—OF ALL TIME.

GEORGE BERNARD SHAW (1856-1950) WAS BORN IN DUBLIN, THE SON OF A CIVIL SERVANT. HIS EDUCATION WAS IRREGULAR, DUE TO

HIS DISLIKE OF ANY ORGANIZED TRAINING. AFTER WORKING IN AN ESTATE AGENT'S OFFICE FOR A WHILE HE MOVED TO LONDON AS A YOUNG
MAN (1876), WHERE HE ESTABLISHED HIMSELF AS A LEADING MUSIC AND THEATRE CRITIC IN THE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES AND BECAME A
PROMINENT MEMBER OF THE FABIAN SOCIETY, FOR WHICH HE COMPOSED MANY PAMPHLETS. HE BEGAN HIS LITERARY CAREER AS A
NOVELIST; AS A FERVENT ADVOCATE OF THE NEW THEATRE OF IBSEN (THE QUINTESSENCE OF IBSENISM, 1891) HE DECIDED TO WRITE PLAYS
IN ORDER TO ILLUSTRATE HIS CRITICISM OF THE ENGLISH STAGE. HIS EARLIEST DRAMAS WERE CALLED APPROPRIATELY PLAYS PLEASANT AND
UNPLEASANT (1898). AMONG THESE, WIDOWER'S HOUSES AND MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION SAVAGELY ATTACK SOCIAL HYPOCRISY, WHILE
IN PLAYS SUCH AS ARMS AND THE MAN AND THE MAN OF DESTINY THE CRITICISM IS LESS FIERCE. SHAW'S RADICAL RATIONALISM, HIS UTTER
DISREGARD OF CONVENTIONS, HIS KEEN DIALECTIC INTEREST AND VERBAL WIT OFTEN TURN THE STAGE INTO A FORUM OF IDEAS, AND
NOWHERE MORE OPENLY THAN IN THE FAMOUS DISCOURSES ON THE LIFE FORCE, «DON JUAN IN HELL», THE THIRD ACT OF THE
DRAMATIZATION OF WOMAN'S LOVE CHASE OF MAN, MAN AND SUPERMAN (1903).

IN THE PLAYS OF HIS LATER PERIOD DISCUSSION SOMETIMES DROWNS THE DRAMA, IN BACK TO METHUSELAH (192 1), ALTHOUGH IN THE
SAME PERIOD HE WORKED ON HIS MASTERPIECE SAINT JOAN (1923), IN WHICH HE REWRITES THE WELL-KNOWN STORY OF THE FRENCH
MAIDEN AND EXTENDS IT FROM THE MIDDLE AGES TO THE PRESENT.

OTHER IMPORTANT PLAYS BY SHAW ARE CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA (1901), A HISTORICAL PLAY FILLED WITH ALLUSIONS TO MODERN TIMES,
AND ANDROCLES AND THE LION (1912), IN WHICH HE EXERCISED A KIND OF RETROSPECTIVE HISTORY AND FROM MODERN MOVEMENTS
DREW DEDUCTIONS FOR THE CHRISTIAN ERA. IN MAJOR BARBARA (1905), ONE OF SHAW'S MOST SUCCESSFUL «DISCUSSION» PLAYS,

THE AUDIENCE'S ATTENTION IS HELD BY THE POWER OF THE WITTY ARGUMENTATION THAT MAN CAN ACHIEVE AESTHETIC SALVATION ONLY
THROUGH POLITICAL ACTIVITY, NOT AS AN INDIVIDUAL. THE Doctor's DILEMMA (1906), FACETIOUSLY CLASSIFIED AS A TRAGEDY BY SHAW,
IS REALLY A COMEDY THE HUMOUR OF WHICH IS DIRECTED AT THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. CANDIDA (1898), WITH SOCIAL ATTITUDES TOWARD
SEX RELATIONS AS OBJECTS OF HIS SATIRE, AND PYGMALION (1912), A WITTY STUDY OF PHONETICS AS WELL AS A CLEVER TREATMENT OF

BD MIDDLE-CLASS MORALITY AND CLASS DISTINCTION, PROVED SOME OF SHAW'S GREATEST SUCCESSES ON THE STAGE. IT IS A COMBINATION OF

THE DRAMATIC, THE COMIC, AND THE SOCIAL CORRECTIVE THAT GIVES SHAW'S COMEDIES THEIR SPECIAL FLAVOUR.

SHAW'S COMPLETE WORKS APPEARED IN THIRTY-SIX VOLUMES BETWEEN 1930 AND 1950, THE YEAR OF HIS DEATH.

"NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR' WAS PUBLISHED FOUR YEARS LATER. SET IN AN IMAGINARY TOTALITARIAN FUTURE, THE BOOK MADE A DEEP
IMPRESSION, WITH ITS TITLE AND MANY PHRASES - SUCH AS 'BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU', 'NEWSPEAK' AND 'DOUBLETHINK' - ENTERING
POPULAR USE. BY NOW ORWELL'S HEALTH WAS DETERIORATING AND HE DIED OF TUBERCULOSIS ON 21 JANUARY 1950.

HENRY FORD (JULY 30, 1863 — APRIL 7, 1947) WAS AN AMERICAN INDUSTRIALIST, THE FOUNDER OF THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY, AND
SPONSOR OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ASSEMBLY LINE TECHNIQUE OF MASS PRODUCTION. ALTHOUGH FORD DID NOT INVENT THE
AUTOMOBILE, HE DEVELOPED AND MANUFACTURED THE FIRST AUTOMOBILE THAT MANY MIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS COULD AFFORD TO
BUY. HIS INTRODUCTION OF THE MODEL T AUTOMOBILE REVOLUTIONIZED TRANSPORTATION AND AMERICAN INDUSTRY. AS OWNER OF
THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY, HE BECAME ONE OF THE RICHEST AND BEST-KNOWN PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. HE IS CREDITED WITH
"FORDISM": MASS PRODUCTION OF INEXPENSIVE GOODS COUPLED WITH HIGH WAGES FOR WORKERS. FORD HAD A GLOBAL VISION, WITH
CONSUMERISM AS THE KEY TO PEACE. HIS INTENSE COMMITMENT TO SYSTEMATICALLY LOWERING COSTS RESULTED IN MANY TECHNICAL
AND BUSINESS INNOVATIONS, INCLUDING A FRANCHISE SYSTEM THAT PUT DEALERSHIPS THROUGHOUT MOST OF NORTH AMERICA AND IN
MAJOR CITIES ON SIX CONTINENTS. FORD LEFT MOST OF HIS VAST WEALTH TO THE FORD FOUNDATION BUT ARRANGED FOR HIS FAMILY TO
CONTROL THE COMPANY PERMANENTLY.

FORD WAS ALSO WIDELY KNOWN FOR HIS PACIFISM DURING THE FIRST YEARS OF WORLD War I, BUT ALSO FOR BEING THE PUBLISHER OF
ANTISEMITIC TEXTS SUCH AS THE BOOK THE INTERNATIONAL JEW.

HUMOUR OR HUMOR IS THE TENDENCY OF PARTICULAR COGNITIVE EXPERIENCES TO PROVOKE LAUGHTER AND PROVIDE AMUSEMENT.
THE TERM DERIVES FROM THE HUMORAL MEDICINE OF THE ANCIENT GREEKS, WHICH TAUGHT THAT THE BALANCE OF FLUIDS IN THE
HUMAN BODY, KNOWN AS HUMORS (LATIN: HUMOR, "BODY FLUID"), CONTROL HUMAN HEALTH AND EMOTION.

PEOPLE OF ALL AGES AND CULTURES RESPOND TO HUMOUR. THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO EXPERIENCE HUMOUR, i.e., TO BE
AMUSED, TO LAUGH OR SMILE AT SOMETHING FUNNY, AND THUS THEY ARE CONSIDERED TO HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOUR. THE
HYPOTHETICAL PERSON LACKING A SENSE OF HUMOUR WOULD LIKELY FIND THE BEHAVIOUR INDUCED BY HUMOUR TO BE
INEXPLICABLE, STRANGE, OR EVEN IRRATIONAL. THOUGH ULTIMATELY DECIDED BY PERSONAL TASTE, THE EXTENT TO WHICH A PERSON
WILL FIND SOMETHING HUMOROUS DEPENDS UPON A HOST OF VARIABLES, INCLUDING GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION, CULTURE, MATURITY,
LEVEL OF EDUCATION, INTELLIGENCE AND CONTEXT. FOR EXAMPLE, YOUNG CHILDREN MAY FAVOUR SLAPSTICK, SUCH AS PUNCH AND
JUDY PUPPET SHOWS OR CARTOONS SUCH AS TOM AND JERRY. SATIRE MAY RELY MORE ON UNDERSTANDING THE TARGET OF THE
HUMOUR AND THUS TENDS TO APPEAL TO MORE MATURE AUDIENCES.

MANY THEORIES EXIST ABOUT WHAT HUMOUR IS AND WHAT SOCIAL FUNCTION IT SERVES. THE PREVAILING TYPES OF THEORIES
ATTEMPTING TO ACCOUNT FOR THE EXISTENCE OF HUMOUR INCLUDE PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORIES, THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHICH
CONSIDER HUMOUR-INDUCED BEHAVIOUR TO BE VERY HEALTHY; SPIRITUAL THEORIES, WHICH MAY, FOR INSTANCE, CONSIDER HUMOUR
TO BE A “GIFT FROM GOD”; AND THEORIES WHICH CONSIDER HUMOUR TO BE AN UNEXPLAINABLE MYSTERY, VERY MUCH LIKE A MYSTICAL
EXPERIENCE.

HUMOR IS MANKIND'S GREATEST BLESSING. -- MARK TWAIN

The difference between genius and stupidity is; genius has its limits. —

The trouble with having an open mind, of course, is that people will insist on coming

The statistics on sanity are that one out of every four people is suffering from a mental
illness. Look at your 3 best friends. If they're ok, then it's you. —

A person without a sense of humor is like a wagon without springs. It's jolted by
every pebble on the road. —

A well-developed sense of humor is the pole that adds balance to your steps as you
walk the tightrope of life. —

You can turn painful situations around through laughter. If you can find humor in
anything, even poverty, you can survive it. —

Everything human is pathetic. The secret source of humor itself is not joy but sorrow.
There is no humor in heaven. —

Analyzing humor is like dissecting a frog. Few people are interested

and the frog dies of it. —

When humor goes, there goes civilization. —
The secret to humor is surprise. —

I think the next best thing to solving a problem is ane some humor in it.

Humor is laughing at what you haven't got when you ought to have it
Humor is a rubber sword - it allows you to make a point without drawing blood

Defining and analyzing humor is a pastime of humorless people. —

I suppose I'll have to add the force of gravity to my list of enemies. —

That is the saving grace of humor, if you fail no one is laughing at you
I do not want people to be very agreeable, as it saves me the trouble of liking them a
great deal. —

HUMANITY OR HUMAN NATURE REFERS TO THE DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING WAYS OF THINKING, FEELING AND
ACTING, THAT HUMANS TEND TO HAVE NATURALLY, I.E. INDEPENDENTLY OF THE INFLUENCE OF CULTURE. THE QUESTIONS OF WHAT THESE
CHARACTERISTICS ARE, WHAT CAUSES THEM, AND HOW FIXED HUMAN NATURE IS, ARE AMONGST THE OLDEST AND MOST

IMPORTANT QUESTIONS IN WESTERN PHILOSOPHY. THESE QUESTIONS HAVE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS IN ETHICS,
POLITICS, AND THEOLOGY. THIS IS PARTLY BECAUSE HUMAN NATURE CAN BE REGARDED AS BOTH A SOURCE OF NORMS OF CONDUCT OR
WAYS OF LIFE, AS WELL AS PRESENTING OBSTACLES OR CONSTRAINTS ON LIVING A GOOD LIFE. THE COMPLEX IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH
QUESTIONS ARE ALSO DEALT WITH IN ART AND LITERATURE, WHILE THE MULTIPLE BRANCHES OF THE HUMANITIES TOGETHER FORM AN
IMPORTANT DOMAIN OF INQUIRY INTO HUMAN NATURE, AND THE QUESTION OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN.

THE BRANCHES OF CONTEMPORARY SCIENCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE STUDY OF HUMAN NATURE INCLUDE ANTHROPOLOGY, SOCIOLOGY,
SOCIOBIOLOGY, AND PSYCHOLOGY, PARTICULARLY EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY, AND DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY. THE "NATURE
VERSUS NURTURE" DEBATE IS A BROADLY INCLUSIVE AND WELL-KNOWN INSTANCE OF A DISCUSSION ABOUT HUMAN NATURE IN THE
NATURAL SCIENCES.

THE EXISTENCE OF THIS INVARIABLE HUMAN NATURE IS, HOWEVER, A SUBJECT OF MUCH HISTORICAL DEBATE, CONTINUING INTO MODERN
TIMES. AGAINST THIS IDEA OF A FIXED HUMAN NATURE, THE RELATIVE MALLEABILITY OF MAN HAS BEEN ARGUED ESPECIALLY STRONGLY
IN RECENT CENTURIES—FIRSTLY BY EARLY MODERNISTS SUCH AS THOMAS HOBBES AND JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU, THE LATTER OF WHOM
STATED:

“WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT OUR NATURE PERMITS US TO BE. - JEAN- JACQUES ROUSSEAU, EMILE”

SINCE THE MID-19TH CENTURY, THINKERS SUCH AS HEGEL, MARX, NIETZSCHE, SARTRE, STRUCTURALISTS AND POSTMODERNISTS HAVE
ALSO SOMETIMES ARGUED AGAINST A FIXED OR INNATE HUMAN NATURE. STILL MORE RECENT SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVES SUCH AS
BEHAVIORISM, DETERMINISM, AND THE CHEMICAL MODEL WITHIN MODERN PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHOLOGY, CLAIM TO BE NEUTRAL
REGARDING HUMAN NATURE. (AS IN ALL MODERN SCIENCE THEY SEEK TO EXPLAIN WITHOUT RECOURSE TO METAPHYSICAL CAUSATION.)
THEY CAN BE OFFERED TO EXPLAIN ITS ORIGINS AND UNDERLYING MECHANISMS, OR TO DEMONSTRATE CAPACITIES FOR CHANGE AND
DIVERSITY WHICH WOULD ARGUABLY VIOLATE THE CONCEPT OF A FIXED HUMAN NATURE.

 Inspiration

 

 

 
 LIEUSIPLURISTLLOLILALE

INSPIRATION (FROM THE LATIN INSPIRARE, MEANING "TO BREATHE INTO") REFERS TO AN UNCONSCIOUS BURST
OF CREATIVITY IN A LITERARY, MUSICAL, OR OTHER ARTISTIC ENDEAVOUR. THE CONCEPT HAS ORIGINS IN BOTH HELLENISM
AND HEBRAISM. THE GREEKS BELIEVED THAT INSPIRATION CAME FROM THE MUSES, AS WELL AS THE GODS APOLLO AND

 

DIONYSUS. SIMILARLY, IN THE ANCIENT NORSE RELIGIONS, INSPIRATION DERIVES FROM THE GODS, SUCH AS ODIN.
INSPIRATION IS ALSO A DIVINE MATTER IN HEBREW POETICS. IN THE BOOK OF AMOS THE PROPHET SPEAKS OF BEING
OVERWHELMED BY GOD'S VOICE AND COMPELLED TO SPEAK. IN CHRISTIANITY, INSPIRATION IS A GIFT OF THE HOLy SPIRIT.

IN THE 18TH CENTURY PHILOSOPHER JOHN LOCKE PROPOSED A MODEL OF THE HUMAN MIND IN WHICH IDEAS ASSOCIATE OR
RESONATE WITH ONE ANOTHER IN THE MIND. IN THE 19TH CENTURY, ROMANTIC POETS SUCH AS COLERIDGE AND SHELLEY
BELIEVED THAT INSPIRATION CAME TO A POET BECAUSE THE POET WAS ATTUNED TO THE (DIVINE OR MYSTICAL) "WINDS" AND
BECAUSE THE SOUL OF THE POET WAS ABLE TO RECEIVE SUCH VISIONS. IN THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY, PSYCHOANALYST
SIGMUND FREUD LOCATED INSPIRATION IN THE INNER PSYCHE OF THE ARTIST. PSYCHIATRIST CARL GUSTAV JUNG'S THEORY
OF INSPIRATION SUGGESTS THAT AN ARTIST IS ONE WHO WAS ATTUNED TO RACIAL MEMORY, WHICH ENCODED THE
ARCHETYPES OF THE HUMAN MIND.

THE MARXIST THEORY OF ART SEES IT AS THE EXPRESSION OF THE FRICTION BETWEEN ECONOMIC BASE AND ECONOMICS
UPERSTRUCTURAL POSITIONS, OR AS AN UNAWARE DIALOG OF COMPETING IDEOLOGIES, OR AS AN EXPLOITATION OF A
"FISSURE" IN THE RULING CLASS'S IDEOLOGY. IN MODERN PSYCHOLOGY INSPIRATION IS NOT FREQUENTLY STUDIED, BUT IT IS
GENERALLY SEEN AS AN ENTIRELY INTERNAL PROCESS.

ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL AND MURDEROUS DICTATORS IN HISTORY, STALIN WAS THE SUPREME RULER OF THE SOVIET
UNION FOR A QUARTER OF A CENTURY. HIS REGIME OF TERROR CAUSED THE DEATH AND SUFFERING OF TENS OF MILLIONS,
BUT HE ALSO OVERSAW THE WAR MACHINE THAT PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN THE DEFEAT OF NAZISM.

IOSIF VISSARIONOVICH DZHUGASHVILI WAS BORN ON 18 DECEMBER 1879 IN GORI, GEORGIA, WHICH WAS THEN PART OF THE
RUSSIAN EMPIRE. HIS FATHER WAS A COBBLER AND STALIN GREW UP IN MODEST CIRCUMSTANCES. HE STUDIED AT A THEOLOGICAL
SEMINARY WHERE HE BEGAN TO READ MARXIST LITERATURE. HE NEVER GRADUATED, INSTEAD DEVOTING HIS TIME TO THE
REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT AGAINST THE RUSSIAN MONARCHY. HE SPENT THE NEXT 15 YEARS AS AN ACTIVIST AND ON A NUMBER OF
OCCASIONS WAS ARRESTED AND EXILED TO SIBERIA.

STALIN WAS NOT ONE OF THE DECISIVE PLAYERS IN THE BOLSHEVIK SEIZURE OF POWER IN 1917, BUT HE SOON ROSE THROUGH THE
RANKS OF THE PARTY. IN 1922, HE WAS MADE GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY, A POST NOT CONSIDERED PARTICULARLY
SIGNIFICANT AT THE TIME BUT WHICH GAVE HIM CONTROL OVER APPOINTMENTS AND THUS ALLOWED HIM TO BUILD UP A BASE OF
SUPPORT. AFTER LENIN'S DEATH IN 1924, STALIN PROMOTED HIMSELF AS HIS POLITICAL HEIR AND GRADUALLY OUTMANOEUVRED HIS
RIVALS. BY THE LATE 1920S, STALIN WAS EFFECTIVELY THE DICTATOR OF THE SOVIET UNION.

HIS FORCED COLLECTIVISATION OF AGRICULTURE COST MILLIONS OF LIVES, WHILE HIS PROGRAMME OF RAPID INDUSTRIALISATION
ACHIEVED HUGE INCREASES IN SOVIET PRODUCTIVITY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH BUT AT GREAT COST. MOREOVER, THE POPULATION
SUFFERED IMMENSELY DURING THE GREAT TERROR OF THE 1930S, DURING WHICH STALIN PURGED THE PARTY OF 'ENEMIES OF THE
PEOPLE’, RESULTING IN THE EXECUTION OF THOUSANDS AND THE EXILE OF MILLIONS TO THE GULAG SYSTEM OF SLAVE LABOUR CAMPS.

AFTER WORLD WAR TWO, THE SOVIET UNION ENTERED THE NUCLEAR AGE AND RULED OVER AN EMPIRE WHICH INCLUDED MOST OF
EASTERN EUROPE. INCREASINGLY PARANOID, STALIN DIED OF A STROKE ON 5 MARCH 1953.

HE HAS BEEN CALLED "THE ROBIN HOOD OF HACKING." As THE FOUNDER AND PUBLIC FACE OF WIKILEAKS, A WEBSITE THAT POSTS SECRET
DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN, JULIAN ASSANGE (PRONOUNCED AH-SANJ) BELIEVES THAT TOTAL TRANSPARENCY IS
FOR THE GOOD OF ALL PEOPLE. BUT ASSANGE — WHO REPORTEDLY LIVES AN ITINERANT EXISTENCE, TRAVELING THE WORLD WITH A BACKPACK
AND COMPUTER — IS HIMSELF A SHADOWY FIGURE. LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HIS LIFE: HE HAS REFUSED TO CONFIRM HIS AGE IN INTERVIEWS OR
GIVE A FIXED ADDRESS. BUT ON JULY 26, THE MATHEMATICALLY-TRAINED AUSTRALIAN CHANGED THE MEDIA LANDSCAPE — AND POSSIBLY THE
COURSE OF HISTORY — BY RELEASING ABOUT 90,000 CLASSIFIED U.S. MILITARY RECORDS FROM THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN.

Fast FAcTs:

e ASSANGE WAS REPORTEDLY BORN IN 1971 IN THE CITY OF TOWNSVILLE, NORTHEASTERN AUSTRALIA. HE WAS MOSTLY HOMESCHOOLED

AS A CHILD, THANKS IN LARGE PART TO HIS ALREADY PERIPATETIC EXISTENCE: BY THE TIME HE WAS 14, HE AND HIS MOTHER HAD
REPORTEDLY MOVED 37 TIMES.

e AFTER HIS MOTHER’S RELATIONSHIP WITH A MUSICIAN TURNED VIOLENT, ASSANGE LIVED ON THE RUN BETWEEN THE AGES OF 11 AND 16.

e WHEN ASSANGE TURNED 16, HE BEGAN HACKING COMPUTERS, REPORTEDLY ASSUMING THE NAME MENDAX — FROM THE LATIN
SPLENDIDE MENDAX, OR “NOBLY UNTRUTHFUL.”

e IN 1991, AT THE AGE OF 20, ASSANGE AND SOME FELLOW HACKERS BROKE INTO THE MASTER TERMINAL OF NORTEL, THE CANADIAN
TELECOM COMPANY. HE WAS CAUGHT AND PLEADED GUILTY TO 25 CHARGES; SIX OTHER CHARGES WERE DROPPED. CITING ASSANGE’S
“{NTELLIGENT INQUISITIVENESS,” THE JUDGE SENTENCED HIM ONLY TO PAY THE AUSTRALIAN STATE A SMALL SUM IN DAMAGES.

e ASSANGE STUDIED MATH AND PHYSICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE, THOUGH HE DROPPED OUT WHEN HE BECAME CONVINCED
THAT WORK BY OTHERS IN THE DEPARTMENT WAS BEING APPLIED BY DEFENSE CONTRACTORS AND MILITARIES.

e IN 2006, ASSANGE DECIDED TO FOUND WIKILEAKS IN THE BELIEF THAT THE FREE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WOULD PUT AN END TO
ILLEGITIMATE GOVERNANCE. THE WEBSITE PUBLISHES MATERIAL FROM SOURCES, AND HOUSES ITS MAIN SERVER IN SWEDEN, WHICH HAS
STRONG LAWS PROTECTING WHISTLE-BLOWERS. ASSANGE AND OTHERS AT WIKILEAKS ALSO OCCASIONALLY HACK INTO SECURE SYSTEMS TO
FIND DOCUMENTS TO EXPOSE. IN DECEMBER 2006, THE WEBSITE PUBLISHED ITS FIRST DOCUMENT: A DECISION BY THE SOMALI ISLAMIC
CourTS UNION THAT CALLED FOR THE EXECUTION OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. WIKILEAKS PUBLISHED A DISCLAIMER THAT THE DOCUMENT
MAY NOT BE AUTHENTIC BUT “A CLEVER SMEAR BY U.S. INTELLIGENCE.”

¢ THE WEBSITE WENT ON TO GET SEVERAL PROMINENT SCOOPS, INCLUDING THE RELEASE IN APRIL 2010 OF A SECRET VIDEO TAKEN IN 2007
OF A U.S. HELICOPTER ATTACK IN IRAQ THAT KILLED A DOZEN CIVILIANS, INCLUDING TWO UNARMED REUTERS JOURNALISTS. ASSANGE HELPED
POST THE VIDEO FROM A SAFE HOUSE IN ICELAND THAT HE AND THE OTHER WIKILEAKS ADMINISTRATORS CALLED “THE BUNKER.”

A HUGELY INFLUENTIAL REVOLUTIONARY THINKER AND PHILOSOPHER, MARX DID NOT LIVE TO SEE HIS IDEAS CARRIED OUT IN
HIS OWN LIFETIME, BUT HIS WRITINGS FORMED THE THEORETICAL BASE FOR MODERN INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM.

KARL HEINRICH MARX WAS BORN ON 5 May 1818 IN TRIER IN WESTERN GERMAN, THE SON OF A SUCCESSFUL JEWISH LAWYER. MARX
STUDIED LAW IN BONN AND BERLIN, BUT WAS ALSO INTRODUCED TO THE IDEAS OF HEGEL AND FEUERBACH. IN 1841, HE RECEIVED A
DOCTORATE IN PHILOSOPHY FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF JENA. IN 1843, AFTER A SHORT SPELL AS EDITOR OF A LIBERAL NEWSPAPER IN
COLOGNE, MARX AND HIS WIFE JENNY MOVED TO PARIS, A HOTBED OF RADICAL THOUGHT. THERE HE BECAME A REVOLUTIONARY
COMMUNIST AND BEFRIENDED HIS LIFE LONG COLLABORATOR, FRIEDRICH ENGELS. EXPELLED FROM FRANCE, MARX SPENT TWO YEARS
IN BRUSSELS, WHERE HIS PARTNERSHIP WITH ENGELS INTENSIFIED. THEY CO-AUTHORED THE PAMPHLET "THE COMMUNIST MANIFESTO'
WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN 1848 AND ASSERTED THAT ALL HUMAN HISTORY HAD BEEN BASED ON CLASS STRUGGLES, BUT THAT THESE
WOULD ULTIMATELY DISAPPEAR WITH THE VICTORY OF THE PROLETARIAT.

IN 1849, MARX MOVED TO LONDON, WHERE HE WAS TO SPEND THE REMAINDER OF HIS LIFE. FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS, HIS FAMILY LIVED
IN POVERTY BUT THE WEALTHIER ENGELS WAS ABLE TO SUPPORT THEM TO AN INCREASING EXTENT. GRADUALLY, MARX EMERGED FROM
HIS POLITICAL AND SPIRITUAL ISOLATION AND PRODUCED HIS MOST IMPORTANT BODY OF WORK, 'DAS KAPITAL'. THE FIRST VOLUME OF
THIS 'BIBLE OF THE WORKING CLASS' WAS PUBLISHED IN HIS LIFETIME, WHILE THE REMAINING VOLUMES WERE EDITED BY ENGELS AFTER
HIS FRIEND'S DEATH.

IN HIS FINAL YEARS, KARL MARX WAS IN CREATIVE AND PHYSICAL DECLINE. HE SPENT TIME AT HEALTH SPAS AND WAS DEEPLY DISTRESSED
BY THE DEATH OF HIS WIFE, IN 1881, AND ONE OF HIS DAUGHTERS. HE DIED ON 14 MARCH 1883 AND WAS BURIED AT HIGHGATE
CEMETERY IN LONDON.

LEV NIKOLAEVICH (LEO) TOLSTOY (1828-1910). A RUSSIAN NOVELIST, REFORMER, AND MORAL THINKER.

 

TOLSTOY WAS BORN AT YASNAYA POLYANA, THE TOLSTOY FAMILY ESTATE A HUNDRED MILES SOUTH OF Moscow, ON AUGUST 28. HE DIED
ON NOVEMBER 20 AT A NEARBY RAILROAD STATION, HAVING FLED IN THE NIGHT FROM AN INCREASINGLY CONTENTIOUS MARRIAGE AND A
SET OF FAMILIAL RELATIONSHIPS THAT HAD BEEN HARDENED IN LARGE PART BY TOLSTOY'S ATTEMPTS TO APPLY HIS RADICAL MORAL
BELIEFS TO HIS OWN LIFE. IN THE INTERVENING EIGHTY-TWO YEARS TOLSTOY BECAME PERHAPS THE MOST PROMINENT NOVELIST IN AN AGE
AND PLACE OF GREAT AUTHORS AS WELL AS A VOCIFEROUS CRITIC OF SCIENCE AND MODERNIZATION.

TOLSTOY'S INTERNATIONAL FAME RESTS PRIMARILY ON TWO NOVELS, WAR AND PEACE (1865-1869) AND ANNA KARENINA (1875-1877).
HIS FICTIONAL WORKS ALSO INCLUDE SHORT MASTERPIECES SUCH AS "THE DEATH OF IVAN ILYICH" (1886), "THE KREUTZER SONATA"
(1889), AND "MASTER AND MAN" (1895). IN ADDITION HE WROTE AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL ACCOUNTS OF HIS CHILDHOOD (CHILDHOOD,
BOYHOOD, YOUTH[1852-1857]) AND HIS EXPERIENCES AS A SOLDIER IN THE CRIMEAN WAR (SEVASTOPOL SKETCHES [1855]). WITH
REGARD TO ISSUES OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND ETHICS TOLSTOY'S MOST RELEVANT WRITINGS INCLUDE A VARIETY OF SHORT,
PASSIONATE NON-FICTION WORKS, PARTICULARLY "WHAT I BELIEVE" (1884), "WHAT THEN Must WE Do?" (1887), "ON THE
SIGNIFICANCE OF SCIENCE AND ART" (1887), "WHAT Is ART?" (1898), AND "I CANNOT BE SILENT" (1908), ALL OF WHICH ADDRESS A
CONFLUENCE OF MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL ERRORS HE PERCEIVED IN MODERN LIFE AND THOUGHT AT THE TURN OF THE TWENTIETH
CENTURY.

LIKE HIS CONTEMPORARY FYODOR DOSTOEVSKY (1821-1881), WHOM HE NEVER MET, TOLSTOY WAS BROADLY CONCERNED WITH THE
SPIRITUAL FUTURE OF THE HUMAN RACE. HE ATTEMPTED TO CONFRONT THE GRADUAL MOVEMENT AWAY FROM TRADITIONAL VALUES WITH

DISSIDENTS SUCH AS MOHANDAS GANDHI (1869-1948) AND ALEXANDER SOLZHENITSYN (B. 1918) HAS BEEN ENORMOUS, AND HIS
THOUGHT PROVIDES RESOURCES FOR ETHICAL ASSESSMENTS OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN EXPLORED FULLY.

KNOWN AS 'MAHATMA' (GREAT SOUL), GANDHI WAS THE LEADER OF THE INDIAN NATIONALIST MOVEMENT AGAINST
BRITISH RULE, AND IS WIDELY CONSIDERED THE FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY. HIS DOCTRINE OF NON-VIOLENT
PROTEST TO ACHIEVE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL PROGRESS HAS BEEN HUGELY INFLUENTIAL.

MOHANDAS KARAMCHAND GANDHI WAS BORN ON 2 OCTOBER 1869 IN PORBANDAR IN GUJARAT. AFTER UNIVERSITY, HE
WENT TO LONDON TO TRAIN AS A BARRISTER. HE RETURNED TO INDIA IN 1891 AND IN 1893 ACCEPTED A JOB AT AN INDIAN
LAW FIRM IN DURBAN, SOUTH AFRICA. GANDHI WAS APPALLED BY THE TREATMENT OF INDIAN IMMIGRANTS THERE, AND
JOINED THE STRUGGLE TO OBTAIN BASIC RIGHTS FOR THEM. DURING HIS 20 YEARS IN SOUTH AFRICA HE WAS SENT TO
PRISON MANY TIMES. INFLUENCED PRIMARILY BY HINDUISM, BUT ALSO BY ELEMENTS OF JAINISM AND CHRISTIANITY AS WELL
AS WRITERS INCLUDING TOLSTOY AND THOREAU, GANDHI DEVELOPED THE SATYAGRAHA (‘DEVOTION TO TRUTH’), A NEW
NON-VIOLENT WAY TO REDRESS WRONGS.

IN 1922, GANDHI HIMSELF WAS SENTENCED TO SIX YEARS’ IMPRISONMENT. HE WAS RELEASED AFTER TWO YEARS AND
WITHDREW FROM POLITICS, DEVOTING HIMSELF TO TRYING TO IMPROVE HINDU-MUSLIM RELATIONS, WHICH HAD
WORSENED. IN 1930, GANDHI PROCLAIMED A NEW CAMPAIGN OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE IN PROTEST AT A TAX ON SALT,
LEADING THOUSANDS ON A ‘MARCH TO THE SEA’ TO SYMBOLICALLY MAKE THEIR OWN SALT FROM SEAWATER. IN 1931,
GANDHI ATTENDED THE ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE IN LONDON, AS THE SOLE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE INDIAN NATIONAL
CONGRESS, BUT RESIGNED FROM THE PARTY IN 1934 IN PROTEST AT ITS USE OF NON-VIOLENCE AS A POLITICAL EXPEDIENT.
HE WAS REPLACED AS LEADER BY JAWAHARLAL NEHRU.

IN 1945, THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT BEGAN NEGOTIATIONS WHICH CULMINATED IN THE MOUNTBATTEN PLAN OF JUNE 1947,
AND THE FORMATION OF THE TWO NEW INDEPENDENT STATES OF INDIA AND PAKISTAN, DIVIDED ALONG RELIGIOUS LINES.
MASSIVE INTER-COMMUNAL VIOLENCE MARRED THE MONTHS BEFORE AND AFTER INDEPENDENCE. GANDHI WAS OPPOSED TO
PARTITION, AND NOW FASTED IN AN ATTEMPT TO BRING CALM IN CALCUTTA AND DELHI. ON 30 JANUARY 1948, HE WAS
ASSASSINATED IN DELHI BY A HINDU FANATIC.

WE MAY IGNORE GANDHI AT OUR OWN RISK.

MOTHER TERESA WAS BORN AGNES GONXHA BOJAXHIU IN SKOPJE, MACEDONIA, ON AUGUST 26, 1910. HER FAMILY WAS OF ALBANIAN
DESCENT. AT THE AGE OF TWELVE, SHE FELT STRONGLY THE CALL OF GOD. SHE KNEW SHE HAD TO BE A MISSIONARY TO SPREAD THE LOVE
OF CHRIST. AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN SHE LEFT HER PARENTAL HOME IN SKOPJE AND JOINED THE SISTERS OF LORETO, AN IRISH
COMMUNITY OF NUNS WITH MISSIONS IN INDIA. AFTER A FEW MONTHS’ TRAINING IN DUBLIN SHE WAS SENT TO INDIA, WHERE ON May 24,
1931, SHE TOOK HER INITIAL VOWS AS A NUN. FROM 1931 TO 1948 MOTHER TERESA TAUGHT AT ST. Mary's HIGH SCHOOL IN CALCUTTA,
BUT THE SUFFERING AND POVERTY SHE GLIMPSED OUTSIDE THE CONVENT WALLS MADE SUCH A DEEP IMPRESSION ON HER THAT IN 1948
SHE RECEIVED PERMISSION FROM HER SUPERIORS TO LEAVE THE CONVENT SCHOOL AND DEVOTE HERSELF TO WORKING AMONG THE
POOREST OF THE POOR IN THE SLUMS OF CALCUTTA. ALTHOUGH SHE HAD NO FUNDS, SHE DEPENDED ON DIVINE PROVIDENCE, AND
STARTED AN OPEN-AIR SCHOOL FOR SLUM CHILDREN. SOON SHE WAS JOINED BY VOLUNTARY HELPERS, AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT WAS ALSO
FORTHCOMING. THIS MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR HER TO EXTEND THE SCOPE OF HER WORK.

ON OCTOBER 7, 1950, MOTHER TERESA RECEIVED PERMISSION FROM THE HOLY SEE TO START HER OWN ORDER, "THE MISSIONARIES
OF CHARITY", WHOSE PRIMARY TASK WAS TO LOVE AND CARE FOR THOSE PERSONS NOBODY WAS PREPARED TO LOOK AFTER. IN 1965 THE
SOCIETY BECAME AN INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FAMILY BY A DECREE OF POPE PAUL VI.

THE SOCIETY OF MISSIONARIES HAS SPREAD ALL OVER THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE FORMER SOVIET UNION AND EASTERN EUROPEAN
COUNTRIES. THEY PROVIDE EFFECTIVE HELP TO THE POOREST OF THE POOR IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES IN ASIA, AFRICA, AND LATIN
AMERICA, AND THEY UNDERTAKE RELIEF WORK IN THE WAKE OF NATURAL CATASTROPHES SUCH AS FLOODS, EPIDEMICS, AND FAMINE, AND
FOR REFUGEES. THE ORDER ALSO HAS HOUSES IN NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE AND AUSTRALIA, WHERE THEY TAKE CARE OF THE SHUT-INS,
ALCOHOLICS, HOMELESS, AND AIDS SUFFERERS. THE MISSIONARIES OF CHARITY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD ARE AIDED AND ASSISTED BY
Co-WORKERS WHO BECAME AN OFFICIAL INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION ON MARCH 29, 1969. BY THE 1990S THERE WERE OVER ONE
MILLION CO-WORKERS IN MORE THAN 40 COUNTRIES. ALONG WITH THE CO-WORKERS, THE LAY MISSIONARIES OF CHARITY TRY TO
FOLLOW MOTHER TERESA'S SPIRIT AND CHARISM IN THEIR FAMILIES.

MOTHER TERESA'S WORK HAS BEEN RECOGNISED AND ACCLAIMED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND SHE HAS RECEIVED A NUMBER OF
AWARDS AND DISTINCTIONS, INCLUDING THE POPE JOHN XXIII PEACE PRIZE (1971) AND THE NEHRU PRIZE FOR HER PROMOTION OF
INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND UNDERSTANDING (1972). SHE ALSO RECEIVED THE BALZAN PRIZE (1979) AND THE TEMPLETON AND
MAGSAYSAY AWARDS. MOTHER TERESA DIED ON SEPTEMBER 5, 1997.

ON NOV. 30, 1835, THE SMALL TOWN OF FLORIDA, MO. WITNESSED THE BIRTH OF ITS MOST FAMOUS SON. SAMUEL LANGHORNE
CLEMENS WAS WELCOMED INTO THE WORLD AS THE SIXTH CHILD OF JOHN MARSHALL AND JANE LAMPTON CLEMENS. LITTLE DID JOHN
AND JANE KNOW, THEIR SON SAMUEL WOULD ONE DAY BE KNOWN AS MARK TWAIN - AMERICA'S MOST FAMOUS LITERARY ICON.
APPROXIMATELY FOUR YEARS AFTER HIS BIRTH, IN 1839, THE CLEMENS FAMILY MOVED 35 MILES EAST TO THE TOWN OF HANNIBAL. A
GROWING PORT CITY THAT LIE ALONG THE BANKS OF THE MISSISSIPPI, HANNIBAL WAS A FREQUENT STOP FOR STEAM BOATS ARRIVING BY
BOTH DAY AND NIGHT FROM ST. LOUIS AND NEW ORLEANS.

SAMUEL'S FATHER WAS A JUDGE, AND HE BUILT A TWO-STORY FRAME HOUSE AT 206 HILL STREET IN 1844. AS A YOUNGSTER, SAMUEL
WAS KEPT INDOORS BECAUSE OF POOR HEALTH. HOWEVER, BY AGE NINE, HE SEEMED TO RECOVER FROM HIS AILMENTS AND JOINED THE
REST OF THE TOWN'S CHILDREN OUTSIDE. HE THEN ATTENDED A PRIVATE SCHOOL IN HANNIBAL. WHEN HE WAS 12, HIS FATHER DIED OF
PNEUMONIA, AND AT 13, SAMUEL LEFT SCHOOL TO BECOME A PRINTER'S APPRENTICE. AFTER TWO SHORT YEARS, HE JOINED HIS BROTHER
ORION'S NEWSPAPER AS A PRINTER AND EDITORIAL ASSISTANT. IT WAS HERE THAT YOUNG SAMUEL FOUND HE ENJOYED WRITING.

AT 17, HE LEFT HANNIBAL BEHIND FOR A PRINTER'S JOB IN ST. Lours. WHILE IN ST. LOUIS, CLEMENS BECAME A RIVER PILOT'S
APPRENTICE. HE BECAME A LICENSED RIVER PILOT IN 1858. CLEMENS’ PSEUDONYM, MARK TWAIN, COMES FROM HIS DAYS AS A RIVER
PILOT. IT IS A RIVER TERM WHICH MEANS TWO FATHOMS OR 12-FEET WHEN THE DEPTH OF WATER FOR A BOAT IS BEING SOUNDED. "MARK
TWAIN" MEANS THAT IS SAFE TO NAVIGATE. BECAUSE THE RIVER TRADE WAS BROUGHT TO A STAND STILL BY THE CIVIL WAR IN 1861,
CLEMENS BEGAN WORKING AS A NEWSPAPER REPORTER FOR SEVERAL NEWSPAPERS ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES. IN 1870, CLEMENS
MARRIED OLIVIA LANGDON, AND THEY HAD FOUR CHILDREN.

TWAIN BEGAN TO GAIN FAME WHEN HIS STORY, "THE CELEBRATED JUMPING FROG OF CALAVARAS COUNTY" APPEARED IN THE NEW YORK
SATURDAY PRESS ON NOVEMBER 18, 1865. TWAIN'S FIRST BOOK, "THE INNOCENTS ABROAD," WAS PUBLISHED IN 1869, "THE ADVENTURES
OF TOM SAWYER" IN 1876, AND "THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN" IN 1885. HE WROTE 28 BOOKS AND NUMEROUS SHORT
STORIES, LETTERS AND SKETCHES.

MARK TWAIN PASSED AWAY ON APRIL 21, 1910, BUT HAS A FOLLOWING STILL TODAY. HIS CHILDHOOD HOME IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC AS
A MUSEUM IN HANNIBAL, AND CALAVARAS COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA HOLDS THE CALAVARAS COUNTY FAIR AND JUMPING FROG JUBILEE
EVERY THIRD WEEKEND IN MAy. WALKING TOURS ARE GIVEN IN NEW YORK CITY OF PLACES TWAIN VISITED NEAR HIS BIRTHDAY EVERY

YEAR.

NORMA JEAN BAKER ENDURED A FATHERLESS CHILDHOOD OF SEXUAL ABUSE AND POVERTY AND WAS PUT IN A STRING OF
ORPHANAGES AND FOSTER HOMES AFTER MOTHER GLADYS BAKER (NEE MONROE), WHO SUFFERED MENTAL ILLNESS, WAS
INSTITUTIONALISED.

 

SHE WAS BORN ON 1 JUNE 1926 IN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY HOSPITAL, THE THIRD CHILD OF GLADYS BAKER. SHE LIVED WITH A NUMBER
OF FOSTER PARENTS, AS HER MOTHER WAS MENTALLY UNSTABLE, UNTIL HER MUM'S BEST FRIEND GRACE MCKEE BECAME HER GUARDIAN.

MCKEE WAS INSPIRED BY JEAN HARLOW AND ALLOWED THE NINE-YEAR-OLD NORMA TO WEAR MAKEUP AND CURL HER HAIR UNTIL MCKEE
MARRIED AND SENT NORMA TO AN ORPHANAGE. SHE WAS THEN SENT TO LIVE WITH HER GREAT AUNT OLIVE BRUNINGS AND IT IS THOUGHT
THAT NORMA WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY OLIVE'S SON, WHICH SOME BIOGRAPHERS HAVE CLAIMED LED TO HER LATER BEHAVIOUR,
INCLUDING SUBSTANCE ABUSE. AT 16, SHE ESCAPED HER OLD LIFE BY MARRYING A 21-YEAR-OLD AIRCRAFT PLANT WORKER, JIM
DOUGHERTY, WHO SHE DIVORCED FOUR YEARS LATER. BY THIS TIME SHE HAD BEGUN MODELLING BATHING SUITS AND, AFTER BLEACHING
HER HAIR BLONDE, POSED FOR PIN-UPS AND GLAMOUR PHOTOS.

HowarD HUGHES TRIED TO GET HER A SCREEN TEST BUT WAS BEATEN TO THE PUNCH BY 20TH CENTURY-FOX, WHO SIGNED HER TO A
CONTRACT - AT $125 PER WEEK FOR SIX MONTHS - AND CHANGED HER NAME TO MARILYN MONROE. AFTER APPEARING IN SMALL PARTS IN
FILMS INCLUDING 'LOVE HAPPyY' AND 'ALL ABOUT EVE', MONROE FOUND FAME IN 1953 WITH 'NIAGARA’, ‘GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES’
AND 'How To Marry A MILLIONAIRE’. THAT SAME YEAR, SHE BEGAN DATING BASEBALL PLAYER JO DIMAGGIO, AND A NUDE SPREAD OF
HER APPEARED IN THE DEBUT ISSUE OF PLAYBOY MAGAZINE. MONROE HAD HIT STARDOM.THE NUDE SPREAD CAUSED A SCANDAL WITH HER
STUDIO SO SHE AGREED TO ADMIT SHE HAD POSED FOR THE PHOTO AS SHE WAS STRUGGLING TO PAY HER RENT. THE RESULTING PUBLICITY
CREATED SOME SYMPATHY FOR THE STRUGGLING ACTRESS.

 

MONROE'S WORK BEGAN TO SLOW DOWN BUT, AFTER UNDERGOING PSYCHOANALYSIS, CRITICS PRAISED HER ACTING IN 1956 FILM ‘BUS
Stop’. SHE MARRIED PLAYWRIGHT ARTHUR MILLER THE SAME YEAR, DIVORCING HIM FOUR YEARS ON. IN THE MEANTIME, SHE FELL PREY
TO ALCOHOL AND PILLS, AND SUFFERED TWO MISCARRIAGES. AFTER A YEAR OFF IN 1958, MARILYN RETURNED TO THE SILVER SCREEN FOR
SMASH COMEDY, 'SOME LIKE IT Hot". IN 1960, SHE APPEARED IN ‘LET'S MAKE LOVE’, WITH YVES MONTAND, WITH WHOM SHE HAD AN
AFFAIR. 'THE MISFITS', WRITTEN BY HUSBAND MILLER, WAS TO BE HER FINAL FILM. WORK WAS INTERRUPTED BY EXHAUSTION, AND SHE
WAS THEN FIRED FROM ‘SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE' FOR NOT TURNING UP FOR FILMING.

 

ON 19 May 1962, THE ACTRESS ATTENDED THE EARLY BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION OF JOHN F KENNEDY AT MADISON SQUARE GARDENS AND
SANG 'HAPPY BIRTHDAY MR PRESIDENT’ IN A NOW ICONIC MANNER. SHE WENT INTO SECLUSION AND ON 5 AUGUST 1962, SHE WAS FOUND

A FILM, ALSO CALLED A MOVIE OR MOTION PICTURE, IS A SERIES OF STILL IMAGES ON A STRIP OF PLASTIC WHICH, WHEN RUN
THROUGH A PROJECTOR AND SHOWN ON A SCREEN, CREATES THE ILLUSION OF MOVING IMAGES. A FILM IS CREATED BY PHOTOGRAPHING
ACTUAL SCENES WITH A MOTION PICTURE CAMERA; BY PHOTOGRAPHING DRAWINGS OR MINIATURE MODELS USING TRADITIONAL
ANIMATION TECHNIQUES; BY MEANS OF CGI AND COMPUTER ANIMATION; OR BY A COMBINATION OF SOME OR ALL OF THESE TECHNIQUES
AND OTHER VISUAL EFFECTS. THE PROCESS OF FILMMAKING IS BOTH AN ART AND AN INDUSTRY.

 

FILMS USUALLY INCLUDE AN OPTICAL SOUNDTRACK, WHICH IS A GRAPHIC RECORDING OF THE SPOKEN WORDS, MUSIC AND OTHER
SOUNDS THAT ARE TO ACCOMPANY THE IMAGES. IT RUNS ALONG A PORTION OF THE FILM EXCLUSIVELY RESERVED FOR IT AND IS NOT
PROJECTED.

FILMS ARE CULTURAL ARTIFACTS CREATED BY SPECIFIC CULTURES. THEY REFLECT THOSE CULTURES, AND, IN TURN, AFFECT THEM. FILM IS
CONSIDERED TO BE AN IMPORTANT ART FORM, A SOURCE OF POPULAR ENTERTAINMENT, AND A POWERFUL MEDIUM FOR EDUCATING—OR
INDOCTRINATING—CITIZENS. THE VISUAL BASIS OF FILM GIVES IT A UNIVERSAL POWER OF COMMUNICATION. SOME FILMS HAVE BECOME
POPULAR WORLDWIDE ATTRACTIONS BY USING DUBBING OR SUBTITLES TO TRANSLATE THE DIALOG INTO THE LANGUAGE OF THE VIEWER.

THE INDIVIDUAL IMAGES THAT MAKE UP A FILM ARE CALLED FRAMES. DURING PROJECTION, A ROTATING SHUTTER CAUSES INTERVALS OF
DARKNESS AS EACH FRAME IN TURN IS MOVED INTO POSITION TO BE PROJECTED, BUT THE VIEWER DOES NOT NOTICE THE
INTERRUPTIONS BECAUSE OF AN EFFECT KNOWN AS PERSISTENCE OF VISION, WHEREBY THE EYE RETAINS A VISUAL IMAGE FORA
FRACTION OF A SECOND AFTER THE SOURCE HAS BEEN REMOVED. THE PERCEPTION OF MOTION IS DUE TO A PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT
CALLED BETA MOVEMENT.

BD THE NAME “FILM” ORIGINATES FROM THE FACT THAT PHOTOGRAPHIC FILM (ALSO CALLED FILM STOCK) HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN THE
MEDIUM FOR RECORDING AND DISPLAYING MOTION PICTURES. MANY OTHER TERMS EXIST FOR AN INDIVIDUAL MOTION PICTURE,
INCLUDING PICTURE, PICTURE SHOW, MOVING PICTURE, PHOTOPLAY AND FLICK. THE MOST COMMON TERM IN THE UNITED STATES IS
MOVIE, WHILE IN EUROPE FILM IS PREFERRED. TERMS FOR THE FIELD IN GENERAL INCLUDE THE BIG SCREEN, THE SILVER SCREEN, THE

 

MOVIES AND CINEMA; THE LATTER IS COMMONLY USED IN SCHOLARLY TEXTS AND CRITICAL ESSAYS, ESPECIALLY BY EUROPEAN WRITERS.
IN EARLY YEARS, THE WORD SHEET WAS SOMETIMES USED INSTEAD OF SCREEN.

MUSIC Is AN ART FORM WHOSE MEDIUM IS SOUND AND SILENCE. ITS COMMON ELEMENTS ARE PITCH (WHICH GOVERNS MELODY
AND HARMONY), RHYTHM (AND ITS ASSOCIATED CONCEPTS TEMPO, METER, AND ARTICULATION), DYNAMICS, AND THE SONIC QUALITIES
OF TIMBRE AND TEXTURE. THE WORD DERIVES FROM GREEK it (MOUSIKE; "ART OF THE MUSES’).

THE CREATION, PERFORMANCE, SIGNIFICANCE, AND EVEN THE DEFINITION OF MUSIC VARY ACCORDING TO CULTURE AND SOCIAL
CONTEXT. MUSIC RANGES FROM STRICTLY ORGANIZED COMPOSITIONS (AND THEIR RECREATION IN PERFORMANCE), THROUGH
IMPROVISATIONAL MUSIC TO ALEATORIC FORMS. MUSIC CAN BE DIVIDED INTO GENRES AND SUBGENRES, ALTHOUGH THE DIVIDING
LINES AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MUSIC GENRES ARE OFTEN SUBTLE, SOMETIMES OPEN TO INDIVIDUAL INTERPRETATION, AND
OCCASIONALLY CONTROVERSIAL. WITHIN "THE ARTS", MUSIC MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS A PERFORMING ART, A FINE ART, AND AUDITORY ART.
IT MAY ALSO BE DIVIDED AMONG "ART MUSIC" AND "FOLK MUSIC". THERE IS ALSO A STRONG CONNECTION BETWEEN MUSIC AND
MATHEMATICS.

MUSIC MAY BE PLAYED AND HEARD LIVE, MAY BE PART OF A DRAMATIC WORK OR FILM, OR MAY BE RECORDED.

TO MANY PEOPLE IN MANY CULTURES, MUSIC IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THEIR WAY OF LIFE. ANCIENT GREEK AND INDIAN
PHILOSOPHERS DEFINED MUSIC AS TONES ORDERED HORIZONTALLY AS MELODIES AND VERTICALLY AS HARMONIES. COMMON SAYINGS
SUCH AS "THE HARMONY OF THE SPHERES" AND "IT IS MUSIC TO MY EARS" POINT TO THE NOTION THAT MUSIC IS OFTEN ORDERED AND
PLEASANT TO LISTEN TO. HOWEVER, 20TH-CENTURY COMPOSER JOHN CAGE THOUGHT THAT ANY SOUND CAN BE MUSIC, SAYING, FOR
EXAMPLE, "THERE IS NO NOISE, ONLY SOUND.” MUSICOLOGIST JEAN-JACQUES NATTIEZ SUMMARIZES THE RELATIVIST, POST-MODERN
VIEWPOINT: "THE BORDER BETWEEN MUSIC AND NOISE IS ALWAYS CULTURALLY DEFINED—WHICH IMPLIES THAT, EVEN WITHIN A SINGLE
SOCIETY, THIS BORDER DOES NOT ALWAYS PASS THROUGH THE SAME PLACE; IN SHORT, THERE IS RARELY A CONSENSUS.

By ALL ACCOUNTS THERE IS NO SINGLE AND INTERCULTURAL UNIVERSAL CONCEPT DEFINING WHAT MUSIC MIGHT BE."

OSHO or BHAGWAN SHREE RAJNEESH WAS BORN IN 1931 IN CENTRAL INDIA. HE WAS A CHARISMATIC AND GIFTED SPEAKER WHO
BECAME THE LEADER OF A WORLDWIDE NEW SPIRITUAL MOVEMENT. IT IS SAID THAT AT THE AGE OF 21 HE ATTAINED ENLIGHTENMENT OR
SAMADHI. AT THE TIME HE WAS STUDYING PHILOSOPHY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAUGAR. ON RECEIVING A MASTERS DEGREE HE TAUGHT
PHILOSOPHY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF JABALPUR FOR NINE YEARS.

AS WELL AS TEACHING PHILOSOPHY HE ALSO BEGAN TO ATTRACT DISCIPLES TO FOLLOW HIS OWN ECLECTIC MIX OF PHILOSOPHY AND
RELIGION. IN 1966 HE DECIDED TO LEAVE HIS TEACHING POST AND GIVE FULL ATTENTION TO HIS ROLE AS SPIRITUAL MASTER. IN 1974 HE
MOVED WITH HIS DISCIPLES TO PUNE, INDIA. HERE HE ESTABLISHED A NEW ASHRAM IN A COMFORTABLE SETTING OF 6 ACRES. IN 1980 HE
WAS ATTACKED BY A HINDU FUNDAMENTALIST WHO DISAGREED WITH OSHO’S UNCONVENTIONAL STANCE ON RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY.
IT IS SAID THAT DUE TO POLICE INCOMPETENCE THE ASSAILANT WAS NEVER CONVICTED.

DUE TO FAILING HEALTH OSHO DECIDED TO LEAVE INDIA FOR AMERICA WHERE HE WOULD BE ABLE TO RECEIVE BETTER MEDICAL
TREATMENT. HIS DISCIPLES BOUGHT A LARGE PLOT OF LAND NEAR ANTELOPE, OREGON. HERE THEY WISHED TO BUILD A LARGE ASHRAM
AND OTHER BUILDINGS. THERE WAS OFTEN FRICTION BETWEEN THE LOCAL TOWNSPEOPLE AND THE ASHRAMITES. THERE WAS A CLASH OF
CULTURES AND THE LOCAL TOWNSPEOPLE FELT THREATENED BY THE INFLUX OF DEVOTEES. BECAUSE OF THIS MANY BUILDING PERMITS
WERE DENIED. THIS LED TO ASHRAMITES TRYING TO GET ELECTED DIRECTLY TO THE TOWN COUNCIL. THERE WERE ALSO ALLEGATIONS MADE
THAT FOLLOWERS OF OSHO WERE INVOLVED IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS SPREADING SALMONELLA IN A LOCAL RESTAURANT. MORE
SERIOUSLY THERE WERE ALLEGATIONS OF MURDER MADE AGAINST SOME FOLLOWERS OF OSHO. TWO WERE EVENTUALLY CONVICTED OF THE
MURDER OF CHARLES TURNER WHO HAD TRIED TO CLOSE THE RANCH.

IN 1987 OSHO BECAME FEARFUL OF INVESTIGATION BY THE AUTHORITIES SO HE DECIDED TO LEAVE THE COMPOUND IN OREGON AND WENT
TO SOUTH CAROLINA. HERE HE FELL FOUL OF US IMMIGRATION LAW. HE HAD ARRANGED FALSE MARRIAGES AND OTHER VIOLATIONS OF
IMMIGRATION LAWS. HE WAS GIVEN A SUSPENDED SENTENCE ON THE CONDITION THAT HE LEAVE THE COUNTRY. THEREFORE HE
RELUCTANTLY DECIDED TO LEAVE FOR PUNA IN INDIA. IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT HE DECIDED TO CHANGE HIS NAME FROM RAJNEESH TO
OsHo. THIS IS SAID TO BE A JAPANESE WORD FOR “MASTER”, ALTHOUGH OTHERS SAY OSHO COMES FROM THE TERM “OCEANIC EXPERIENCE”
OSHO DIED IN 1990, HIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE GAVE A REASON OF HEART FAILURE. ALTHOUGH SOME FOLLOWERS ALLEGED POISONING BY THE
U.S, BUT THESE ALLEGATIONS HAD LITTLE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THEM.

experiencing the ecstasy of your own being, you have achieved the final goal.
Comparison is a very foolish attitude, because each person is unique and incompara

incomparable. You are just yourself: nobody has ever been like you, and nobody will

originals; he does not believe in carbon copies.

RABINDRANATH TAGORE (1861-1941) WAS THE YOUNGEST SON OF DEBENDRANATH TAGORE, A LEADER OF THE BRAHMO SAMAJ, WHICH
WAS A NEW RELIGIOUS SECT IN NINETEENTH-CENTURY BENGAL AND WHICH ATTEMPTED A REVIVAL OF THE ULTIMATE MONISTIC BASIS OF
HINDUISM AS LAID DOWN IN THE UPANISHADS. HE WAS EDUCATED AT HOME; AND ALTHOUGH AT SEVENTEEN HE WAS SENT TO

ENGLAND FOR FORMAL SCHOOLING, HE DID NOT FINISH HIS STUDIES THERE. IN HIS MATURE YEARS, IN ADDITION TO HIS MANY-SIDED
LITERARY ACTIVITIES, HE MANAGED THE FAMILY ESTATES, A PROJECT WHICH BROUGHT HIM INTO CLOSE TOUCH WITH COMMON HUMANITY,
AND INCREASED HIS INTEREST IN SOCIAL REFORMS. HE ALSO STARTED AN EXPERIMENTAL SCHOOL AT SHANTINIKETAN WHERE HE TRIED
HIS UPANISHADIC IDEALS OF EDUCATION. FROM TIME TO TIME HE PARTICIPATED IN THE INDIAN NATIONALIST MOVEMENT, THOUGH IN

HIS OWN NON-SENTIMENTAL AND VISIONARY WAY; AND MAHATMA GANDHI, THE POLITICAL FATHER OF MODERN INDIA, WAS HIS DEVOTED
FRIEND. TAGORE WAS KNIGHTED BY THE RULING BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN 1915, BUT WITHIN A FEW YEARS HE RESIGNED THE HONOUR AS
A PROTEST AGAINST BRITISH POLICIES IN INDIA.

TAGORE HAD EARLY SUCCESS AS A WRITER IN HIS NATIVE BENGAL. WITH HIS TRANSLATIONS OF SOME OF HIS POEMS HE BECAME RAPIDLY
KNOWN IN THE WEST. IN FACT HIS FAME ATTAINED A LUMINOUS HEIGHT, TAKING HIM ACROSS CONTINENTS ON LECTURE TOURS AND
TOURS OF FRIENDSHIP. FOR THE WORLD HE BECAME THE VOICE OF INDIA'S SPIRITUAL HERITAGE; AND FOR INDIA, ESPECIALLY FOR BENGAL,
HE BECAME A GREAT LIVING INSTITUTION.

ALTHOUGH TAGORE WROTE SUCCESSFULLY IN ALL LITERARY GENRES, HE WAS FIRST OF ALL A POET. AMONG HIS FIFTY AND ODD VOLUMES
OF POETRY ARE MANASI (1890) [THE IDEAL ONE], SONAR TaRI (1894) [THE GOLDEN BoAT], GITANJALI (1910) [SONG OFFERINGS],
GITIMALYA (1914) [WREATH OF SONGS], AND BALAKA (1916) [THE FLIGHT OF CRANES]. THE ENGLISH RENDERINGS OF HIS POETRY, WHICH
INCLUDE THE GARDENER (1913), FRUIT-GATHERING (1916), AND THE FUGITIVE (1921), DO NOT GENERALLY CORRESPOND TO
PARTICULAR VOLUMES IN THE ORIGINAL BENGALI; AND IN SPITE OF ITS TITLE, GITANJALI: SONG OFFERINGS (1912), THE MOST
ACCLAIMED OF THEM, CONTAINS POEMS FROM OTHER WORKS BESIDES ITS NAMESAKE. TAGORE'S MAJOR PLAYS ARE RAJA (1910) [THE
KING OF THE DARK CHAMBER], DAKGHAR (1912) [THE PosT OFFICE], ACHALAYATAN (1912) [THE IMMOVABLE], MUKTADHARA (1922)
[THE WATERFALL], AND RAKTAKARAVI (1926) [RED OLEANDERS]. HE IS THE AUTHOR OF SEVERAL VOLUMES OF SHORT STORIES AND A
NUMBER OF NOVELS, AMONG THEM GORA (1910), GHARE-BAIRE (1916) [THE HOME AND THE WoRLD], AND YOGAYOG (1929)
[CROSSCURRENTS]. BESIDES THESE, HE WROTE MUSICAL DRAMAS, DANCE DRAMAS, ESSAYS OF ALL TYPES, TRAVEL DIARIES, AND TWO
AUTOBIOGRAPHIES, ONE IN HIS MIDDLE YEARS AND THE OTHER SHORTLY BEFORE HIS DEATH IN 1941. TAGORE ALSO LEFT NUMEROUS
DRAWINGS AND PAINTINGS, AND SONGS FOR WHICH HE WROTE THE MUSIC HIMSELF.

RABINDRANATH TAGORE DIED ON AUGUST 7, 1941.

ROBERT FROST WAS BORN IN SAN FRANCISCO ON MARCH 26, 1874. HE MOVED TO NEW ENGLAND AT THE AGE OF ELEVEN AND BECAME
INTERESTED IN READING AND WRITING POETRY DURING HIS HIGH SCHOOL YEARS IN LAWRENCE, MASSACHUSETTS. HE WAS ENROLLED AT
DARTMOUTH COLLEGE IN 1892, AND LATER AT HARVARD, THOUGH HE NEVER EARNED A FORMAL DEGREE.

FROST DRIFTED THROUGH A STRING OF OCCUPATIONS AFTER LEAVING SCHOOL, WORKING AS A TEACHER, COBBLER, AND EDITOR OF THE
LAWRENCE SENTINEL. HIS FIRST PROFESSIONAL POEM, "My BUTTERELY," WAS PUBLISHED ON NOVEMBER 8, 1894, IN THE NEW YORK
NEWSPAPER THE INDEPENDENT.

IN 1895, FROST MARRIED ELINOR MIRIAM WHITE, WHO BECAME A MAJOR INSPIRATION IN HIS POETRY UNTIL HER DEATH IN 1938. THE
COUPLE MOVED TO ENGLAND IN 1912, AFTER THEIR NEW HAMPSHIRE FARM FAILED, AND IT WAS ABROAD THAT FROST MET AND WAS
INFLUENCED BY SUCH CONTEMPORARY BRITISH POETS AS EDWARD THOMAS, RUPERT BROOKE, AND ROBERT GRAVES. WHILE IN ENGLAND,
FROST ALSO ESTABLISHED A FRIENDSHIP WITH THE POET EZRA POUND, WHO HELPED TO PROMOTE AND PUBLISH HIS WORK.

By THE TIME FROST RETURNED TO THE UNITED STATES IN 1915, HE HAD PUBLISHED TWO FULL-LENGTH COLLECTIONS, A Boy's WILL AND
NORTH OF BOSTON, AND HIS REPUTATION WAS ESTABLISHED. BY THE NINETEEN-TWENTIES, HE WAS THE MOST CELEBRATED POET IN
AMERICA, AND WITH EACH NEW BOOK—INCLUDING NEW HAMPSHIRE (1923), A FURTHER RANGE (1936), STEEPLE BUSH (1947), AND IN THE
CLEARING (1962)—HIS FAME AND HONORS (INCLUDING FOUR PULITZER PRIZES) INCREASED.

THOUGH HIS WORK IS PRINCIPALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE LIFE AND LANDSCAPE OF NEW ENGLAND, AND THOUGH HE WAS A POET OF
TRADITIONAL VERSE FORMS AND METRICS WHO REMAINED STEADFASTLY ALOOF FROM THE POETIC MOVEMENTS AND FASHIONS OF HIS TIME,
FROST IS ANYTHING BUT A MERELY REGIONAL OR MINOR POET. THE AUTHOR OF SEARCHING AND OFTEN DARK MEDITATIONS ON UNIVERSAL
THEMES, HE IS A QUINTESSENTIALLY MODERN POET IN HIS ADHERENCE TO LANGUAGE AS IT IS ACTUALLY SPOKEN, IN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL
COMPLEXITY OF HIS PORTRAITS, AND IN THE DEGREE TO WHICH HIS WORK IS INFUSED WITH LAYERS OF AMBIGUITY AND IRONY.

IN A 1970 REVIEW OF THE POETRY OF ROBERT FROST, THE POET DANIEL HOFFMAN DESCRIBES FROST'S EARLY WORK AS "THE PURITAN ETHIC
TURNED ASTONISHINGLY LYRICAL AND ENABLED TO SAY OUT LOUD THE SOURCES OF ITS OWN DELIGHT IN THE WORLD," AND COMMENTS ON
FROST'S CAREER AS THE AMERICAN BARD: "HE BECAME A NATIONAL CELEBRITY, OUR NEARLY OFFICIAL POET LAUREATE, AND A GREAT
PERFORMER IN THE TRADITION OF THAT EARLIER MASTER OF THE LITERARY VERNACULAR, MARK TWAIN."

ABOUT FROST, PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY SAID, "HE HAS BEQUEATHED HIS NATION A BODY OF IMPERISHABLE VERSE FROM WHICH
AMERICANS WILL FOREVER GAIN JOY AND UNDERSTANDING."

ROBERT FROST LIVED AND TAUGHT FOR MANY YEARS IN MASSACHUSETTS AND VERMONT, AND DIED IN BOSTON ON JANUARY 29, 1963.

SOCRATES (469 BC - 399 BC) WAS A CLASSICAL GREEK ATHENIAN PHILOSOPHER. CREDITED AS ONE OF THE
FOUNDERS OF WESTERN PHILOSOPHY, HE IS AN ENIGMATIC FIGURE KNOWN CHIEFLY THROUGH THE ACCOUNTS
OF LATER CLASSICAL WRITERS, ESPECIALLY THE WRITINGS OF HIS STUDENTS PLATO AND XENOPHON, AND THE
PLAYS OF HIS CONTEMPORARY ARISTOPHANES. MANY WOULD CLAIM THAT PLATO'S DIALOGUES ARE THE MOST
COMPREHENSIVE ACCOUNTS OF SOCRATES TO SURVIVE FROM ANTIQUITY.

THROUGH HIS PORTRAYAL IN PLATO'S DIALOGUES, SOCRATES HAS BECOME RENOWNED FOR HIS CONTRIBUTION
TO THE FIELD OF ETHICS, AND IT IS THIS PLATONIC SOCRATES WHO ALSO LENDS HIS NAME TO THE CONCEPTS
OF SOCRATIC IRONY AND THE SOCRATIC METHOD, OR ELENCHUS. THE LATTER REMAINS A COMMONLY USED
TOOL IN A WIDE RANGE OF DISCUSSIONS, AND IS A TYPE OF PEDAGOGY IN WHICH A SERIES OF QUESTIONS ARE
ASKED NOT ONLY TO DRAW INDIVIDUAL ANSWERS, BUT ALSO TO ENCOURAGE FUNDAMENTAL INSIGHT INTO
THE ISSUE AT HAND. IT Is PLATO'S SOCRATES THAT ALSO MADE IMPORTANT AND LASTING CONTRIBUTIONS

TO THE FIELDS OF EPISTEMOLOGY AND LOGIC, AND THE INFLUENCE OF HIS IDEAS AND APPROACH REMAINS
STRONG IN PROVIDING A FOUNDATION FOR MUCH WESTERN PHILOSOPHY THAT FOLLOWED.

THE ONLY TRUE WISDOM IS IN KNOWING YOU KNOW NOTHING.

(Strong minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events, weak minds discuss people. )

 

 

 

 

By all means marry; if you get a good wife, you'll become happy; if you get a bad one, you

Be slow to fall into friendship, but when you are in, continue firm and constant.
( Sometimes you put walls up not to keep people out, but to see who cares enough to )

\ break them down.
(1am not an Athenian nora Greek, but a citizen of the world. )

(The secret of happiness, you see, is not found in seeking more, but in developing the
capacity to enjoy less.

(When the debate is lost, slander becomes the tool of the loser. )

(Employ your time in improving yourself by other men’s writings so that you shall

| come easily by what others have labored hard for.

(The greatest way to live with honor in this world is to be what we pretend to be. )

(He is richest who is content with the least, for content is the wealth of nature. )

(False words are not only evil in themselves, but they infect the soul with evil. )

 

 

( No man undertakes a trade he has not learned, even the meanest; yet every one thinks himsel
| sufficiently qualified for the hardest of all trades - that of government.

 

 

(‘True wisdom comes to each of us when we realize how little we understand about life,
| ourselves, and the world around us.

 

 

(Remember, no human condition is ever permanent. Then you will not be overjoyed in
good fortune nor too scornful in misfortune.

 

 

(The hour of departure has arrived and we go our ways; I to die, and you to live.
| Which is better? Only God knows.
(False words are not only evil in themselves, but they infect the soul with evil. )

 

 

 

 

 

(From the deepest desires often come the deadliest hate. )

 

 

(Call no man unhappy until he is married. )

(The hottest love has the coldest end._)
Ifa man is proud of his wealth, he should not be praised until it is known how he

"SISTERS AND BROTHERS OF AMERICA," THROUGH WHICH HE INTRODUCED HINDUISM AT THE PARLIAMENT OF THE WORLD'S
RELIGIONS IN CHICAGO IN 1893.

BORN INTO AN ARISTOCRATIC BENGALI FAMILY OF CALCUTTA, VIVEKANANDA SHOWED AN INCLINATION TOWARDS SPIRITUALITY. HE
WAS INFLUENCED BY HIS GURU RAMAKRISHNA FROM WHOM HE LEARNT THAT ALL LIVING BEINGS WERE AN EMBODIMENT OF THE
DIVINE SELF AND HENCE, SERVICE TO GOD COULD BE RENDERED BY SERVICE TO MANKIND. AFTER THE DEATH OF HIS GURU,
VIVEKANANDA TOURED THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT EXTENSIVELY AND ACQUIRED A FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE OF THE CONDITIONS
THAT PREVAILED IN BRITISH INDIA. HE LATER TRAVELLED TO THE UNITED STATES TO REPRESENT INDIA AS A DELEGATE IN THE 1893
PARLIAMENT OF WORLD RELIGIONS. HE CONDUCTED HUNDREDS OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LECTURES AND CLASSES, DISSEMINATING
TENETS OF HINDU PHILOSOPHY IN THE UNITED STATES, ENGLAND AND EuROPE. IN INDIA, VIVEKANANDA IS REGARDED AS A
PATRIOTIC SAINT AND HIS BIRTHDAY IS CELEBRATED AS THE NATIONAL YOUTH Day.

STEVEN PAUL JOBS (FEBRUARY 24, 1955 —- OCTOBER 5, 2011) WAS AN AMERICAN ENTREPRENEUR. HE IS BEST KNOWN AS THE
CO-FOUNDER, CHAIRMAN, AND CEO OF APPLE INC. THROUGH APPLE, HE WAS WIDELY RECOGNIZED AS A CHARISMATIC PIONEER OF THE
PERSONAL COMPUTER REVOLUTION AND FOR HIS INFLUENTIAL CAREER IN THE COMPUTER AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS FIELDS. JOBS
ALSO CO-FOUNDED AND SERVED AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF PIXAR ANIMATION STUDIOS; HE BECAME A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF
DIRECTORS OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY IN 2006, WHEN DISNEY ACQUIRED PIXAR.

IN THE LATE 1970S, APPLE CO-FOUNDER STEVE WOZNIAK ENGINEERED ONE OF THE FIRST COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL LINES OF
PERSONAL COMPUTERS, THE APPLE II SERIES. JOBS WAS AMONG THE FIRST TO SEE THE COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF XEROX PARC's
MOUSE-DRIVEN GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE, WHICH LED TO THE CREATION OF THE APPLE LISA AND, ONE YEAR LATER, THE
MACINTOSH. HE ALSO PLAYED A ROLE IN INTRODUCING THE LASERWRITER, ONE OF THE FIRST WIDELY AVAILABLE LASER PRINTERS, TO
THE MARKET.

AFTER A POWER STRUGGLE WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN 1985, JOBS LEFT APPLE AND FOUNDED NEXT, A COMPUTER PLATFORM
DEVELOPMENT COMPANY SPECIALIZING IN THE HIGHER-EDUCATION AND BUSINESS MARKETS. IN 1986, HE ACQUIRED THE COMPUTER
GRAPHICS DIVISION OF LUCASFILM, WHICH WAS SPUN OFF AS PIXAR. HE WAS CREDITED IN Toy STORY (1995) AS AN EXECUTIVE
PRODUCER. HE SERVED AS CEO AND MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER UNTIL DISNEY'S PURCHASE OF PIXAR IN 2006. IN 1996, AFTER APPLE

IN SOCIOLOGY OR ANTHROPOLOGY, SOCIAL STATUS OR SUCCESS IS THE HONOR OR PRESTIGE ATTACHED TO ONE'S POSITION
IN SOCIETY (ONE'S SOCIAL POSITION). IT MAY ALSO REFER TO A RANK OR POSITION THAT ONE HOLDS IN A GROUP,
FOR EXAMPLE SON OR DAUGHTER, PLAYMATE, PUPIL, ETC.

 

SOCIAL STATUS, THE POSITION OR RANK OF A PERSON OR GROUP WITHIN THE SOCIETY, CAN BE DETERMINED TWO WAYS. ONE CAN EARN
THEIR SOCIAL STATUS BY THEIR OWN ACHIEVEMENTS, WHICH IS KNOWN AS ACHIEVED STATUS. ALTERNATIVELY, ONE CAN BE PLACED IN
THE STRATIFICATION SYSTEM BY THEIR INHERITED POSITION, WHICH IS CALLED ASCRIBED STATUS. ASCRIBED STATUSES CAN ALSO BE
DEFINED AS THOSE THAT ARE FIXED FOR AN INDIVIDUAL AT BIRTH. ASCRIBED STATUSES THAT EXIST IN ALL SOCIETIES INCLUDE THOSE
BASED UPON SEX, AGE, RACE ETHNIC GROUP AND FAMILY BACKGROUND. FOR EXAMPLE, A PERSON BORN INTO A WEALTHY FAMILY
CHARACTERIZED BY TRAITS SUCH AS POPULARITY, TALENTS AND HIGH VALUES WILL HAVE MANY EXPECTATIONS GROWING UP.
THEREFORE, THEY ARE GIVEN AND TAUGHT MANY SOCIAL ROLES AS THEY ARE SOCIALLY POSITIONED INTO A FAMILY BECOMING
EQUIPPED WITH ALL THESE TRAITS AND CHARACTERISTICS. ACHIEVED STATUSES MEANING ALSO WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL ACQUIRES
DURING HIS OR HER LIFETIME AS A RESULT OF THE EXERCISE OF KNOWLEDGE, ABILITY, SKILL AND/OR PERSEVERANCE. OCCUPATION
PROVIDES AN EXAMPLE OF STATUS THAT MAY BE EITHER ASCRIBED OR ACHIEVED, IT CAN BE ACHIEVED BY ONE GAINING THE RIGHT
KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL TO BECOME SOCIALLY POSITIONED INTO A HIGHER POSITION OF THAT JOB; BUILDING A PERSONS SOCIAL
IDENTITY WITHIN THE OCCUPATION.

IN MODERN SOCIETIES, OCCUPATION IS USUALLY THOUGHT OF AS THE MAIN DETERMINANT OF STATUS, BUT OTHER MEMBERSHIPS OR
AFFILIATIONS (SUCH AS ETHNIC GROUP, RELIGION, GENDER, VOLUNTARY ASSOCIATIONS, FANDOM, HOBBY) CAN HAVE AN INFLUENCE.
THE IMPORTANCE OF SOCIAL STATUS CAN BE SEEN IN THE PEER STATUS HIERARCHY OF GEEKS, ATHLETES, CHEERLEADERS, NERDS, AND
WEIRDOS IN HOLLYWOOD STEREOTYPES OF AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOLS. ACHIEVED STATUS IS WHEN PEOPLE ARE PLACED IN THE
STRATIFICATION STRUCTURE BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL MERITS OR ACHIEVEMENTS. THIS STATUS CAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH
EDUCATION, OCCUPATION, AND MARITAL STATUS. THEIR PLACE WITHIN THE STRATIFICATION STRUCTURE IS DETERMINED BY SOCIETY'S
BAR, WHICH OFTEN JUDGES THEM ON SUCCESS, SUCCESS BEING FINANCIAL, ACADEMIC, POLITICAL AND SO ON. AMERICA MOST
COMMONLY USES THIS FORM OF STATUS WITH JOBS. THE HIGHER YOU ARE IN RANK THE BETTER OFF YOU ARE AND THE MORE CONTROL
YOU HAVE OVER YOUR CO-WORKERS.

ONES BEST SUCCESS COMES AFTER THEIR GREATEST DISAPPOINTMENTS. -- HENRY WARD

THOMAS ALVA EDISON, (BORN FEBRUARY 11, 1847, MILAN, OHIO, U.S.—DIED OCTOBER 18, 1931, WEST ORANGE, NEW JERSEY),
AMERICAN INVENTOR WHO, SINGLY OR JOINTLY, HELD A WORLD RECORD 1,093 PATENTS. IN ADDITION, HE CREATED THE WORLD’S
FIRST INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH LABORATORY.

EDISON WAS THE QUINTESSENTIAL AMERICAN INVENTOR IN THE ERA OF YANKEE INGENUITY. HE BEGAN HIS CAREER IN 1863, IN THE
ADOLESCENCE OF THE TELEGRAPH INDUSTRY, WHEN VIRTUALLY THE ONLY SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY WAS PRIMITIVE BATTERIES PUTTING OUT

A LOW-VOLTAGE CURRENT. BEFORE HE DIED, IN 1931, HE HAD PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE IN INTRODUCING THE MODERN AGE OF ELECTRICITY.
FROM HIS LABORATORIES AND WORKSHOPS EMANATED THE PHONOGRAPH, THE CARBON-BUTTON TRANSMITTER FOR THE TELEPHONE SPEAKER
AND MICROPHONE, THE INCANDESCENT LAMP, A REVOLUTIONARY GENERATOR OF UNPRECEDENTED EFFICIENCY, THE FIRST COMMERCIAL
ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER SYSTEM, AN EXPERIMENTAL ELECTRIC RAILROAD, AND KEY ELEMENTS OF MOTION-PICTURE APPARATUS, AS WELL
AS A HOST OF OTHER INVENTIONS.

EDISON WAS THE SEVENTH AND LAST CHILD—THE FOURTH SURVIVING—OF SAMUEL EDISON, JR., AND NANCY ELLIOT EDISON. AT AN EARLY
AGE HE DEVELOPED HEARING PROBLEMS, WHICH HAVE BEEN VARIOUSLY ATTRIBUTED BUT WERE MOST LIKELY DUE TO A FAMILIAL TENDENCY TO
MASTOIDITIS. WHATEVER THE CAUSE, EDISON’S DEAFNESS STRONGLY INFLUENCED HIS BEHAVIOUR AND CAREER, PROVIDING THE MOTIVATION
FOR MANY OF HIS INVENTIONS.

TEAMWORK IS "WORK DONE BY SEVERAL ASSOCIATES WITH EACH DOING A PART BUT ALL SUBORDINATING PERSONAL
PROMINENCE TO THE EFFICIENCY OF THE WHOLE".

IN A BUSINESS SETTING ACCOUNTING TECHNIQUES MAY BE USED TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL MEASURES OF THE BENEFITS OF TEAMWORK
WHICH ARE USEFUL FOR JUSTIFYING THE CONCEPT. TEAMWORK IS INCREASINGLY ADVOCATED BY HEALTH CARE POLICY MAKERS AS A
MEANS OF ASSURING QUALITY AND SAFETY IN THE DELIVERY OF SERVICES; A COMMITTEE OF THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE RECOMMENDED
IN 2000 THAT PATIENT SAFETY PROGRAMS "ESTABLISH INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR PROVIDERS THAT
INCORPORATE PROVEN METHODS OF TEAM TRAINING, SUCH AS SIMULATION."

IN HEALTH CARE, ONE DEFINITION OF TEAMWORK IS "THOSE BEHAVIOURS THAT FACILITATE EFFECTIVE TEAM MEMBER INTERACTION,"
WITH "TEAM" DEFINED AS "A GROUP OF TWO OR MORE INDIVIDUALS WHO PERFORM SOME WORK RELATED TASK, INTERACT WITH ONE
ANOTHER DYNAMICALLY, HAVE A SHARED PAST, HAVE A FORESEEABLE SHARED FUTURE, AND SHARE A COMMON FATE." ONE DEFINITION
FOR TEAMWORK PROPOSED IN 2008 IS "THE INTERDEPENDENT COMPONENTS OF PERFORMANCE REQUIRED TO EFFECTIVELY COORDINATE
THE PERFORMANCE OF MULTIPLE INDIVIDUALS’; AS SUCH, TEAMWORK IS "NESTED WITHIN" THE BROADER CONCEPT OF TEAM
PERFORMANCE WHICH ALSO INCLUDES INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL TASKWORK. ANOTHER DEFINITION PROPOSED IN 2008 IS "A DYNAMIC PROCESS
INVOLVING TWO OR MORE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS WITH COMPLEMENTARY BACKGROUNDS AND SKILLS, SHARING COMMON HEALTH
GOALS AND EXERCISING CONCERTED PHYSICAL AND MENTAL EFFORT IN ASSESSING, PLANNING, OR EVALUATING PATIENT CARE." A 2012
REVIEW OF THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE FOUND THAT THE WORD "TEAMWORK" HAS BEEN USED "AS A CATCHALL TO REFER TO A NUMBER OF
BEHAVIORAL PROCESSES AND EMERGENT STATES.”

VICTOR MARIE VICOMETE HUGO, ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED FRENCH WRITERS, WAS BORN FEBRUARY 26TH, 1802, AT
BESANCON, WHERE HIS FATHER WAS THEN COMMANDANT OF THE GARRISON. HE EARLY ACQUIRED DISTINCTION BY HIS POETIC EFFUSIONS,
AND BEFORE HE WAS THIRTY YEARS OF AGE, HIS PUBLISHED WORKS WERE NUMEROUS, AND HIS NAME FAMOUS. ODES AND BALLADS,
ROMANCES, DRAMAS, ETC., FLOWED FROM HIS PROLIFIC PEN. SHORTLY BEFORE THE REVOLUTION OF 1830, A LITERARY REVOLUTION TOOK
PLACE, AT THE HEAD OF WHICH WAS HuGo. A BAND OF YOUNG MEN, IMAGINATIVE, ARDENT, AND CONFIDENT, SOUGHT TO RENOVATE FRENCH
LITERATURE BY DEPARTING FROM CLASSIC RULES AND MODELS, SUBSTITUTING A VARIED AND VERY IRREGULAR VERSE FOR THE MONOTONOUS
ALEXANDRINES OF THE OLD SCHOOL. THE NEW SCHOOL, "LA JEUNE FRANCE," AS THEY CALLED THEMSELVES, FORMED THE ROMANTICISTS,
AND THEIR OPPONENTS THE CLASSICISTS. THE LITERARY WAR WHICH AROSE LASTED FOR SEVERAL YEARS.

 

HuGo's POPULARITY CONTINUED TO INCREASE, AND IN 1837, LOUIS PHILIPPE MADE HIM AN OFFICER OF THE LEGION OF HONOR, AND IN
1845 A PEER OF FRANCE. AFTER THE REVOLUTION OF 1848, HE WAS ELECTED TO REPRESENT THE CITY OF PARIS, BOTH IN THE CONSTITUENT
AND IN THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY, IN WHICH HE MANIFESTED DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES, AND WAS ONE OF THOSE MEMBERS OF THE

EXTREME LEFT, WHO WERE BANISHED FROM FRANCE FOR LIFE BY Louis NAPOLEON. HE TOOK UP HIS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF JERSEY.
IN 1852, HE ASSAILED THE RULER OF FRANCE IN A REMARKABLE POLITICAL PAMPHLET, NAPOLEON LE PETIT, (NAPOLEON THE LITTLE), WHICH
PRODUCED A GREAT SENSATION; BUT THE EFFECT OF ITS SEVERITY WAS WEAKENCD BY ITS UNDIGNIFIED VIRULENCE. IN 1862, HE PUBLISHED
LES MISERABLES, IN WHICH, WITH GREAT DRAMATIC FORCE, HE HANDLES SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SOCIAL QUESTIONS. HuGo's
WRITINGS HAVE GREAT FAULTS. THEY ARE OFTEN EXTRAVAGANT BOTH IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE, AND SOMETIMES MARRED BY AN AFFECTED
TRIVIALITY OF IMAGES AND HARSHNESS OF VERSIFICATION. YET THEY HAVE ALSO GREAT EXCELLENCIES; THE COMMAND OF LANGUAGE IS
WONDERFUL, AND AS A LYRIC POET, HUGO HAS, PERHAPS, NEVER BEEN EQUALLED IN FRANCE.

VLADIMIR LENIN WAS ONE OF THE LEADING POLITICAL FIGURES AND REVOLUTIONARY THINKERS OF THE 20TH CENTURY, WHO
MASTERMINDED THE BOLSHEVIK TAKE-OVER OF POWER IN RUSSIA IN 1917, AND WAS THE ARCHITECT AND FIRST HEAD OF THE
USSR.

VLADIMIR ILICH ULYANOV WAS BORN IN SIMBIRSK ON THE VOLGA RIVER ON 22 APRIL 1870 INTO A WELL-EDUCATED FAMILY. HE EXCELLED AT
SCHOOL AND WENT ON TO STUDY LAW. AT UNIVERSITY, HE WAS EXPOSED TO RADICAL THINKING, AND HIS VIEWS WERE ALSO INFLUENCED BY
THE EXECUTION OF HIS ELDER BROTHER, A MEMBER OF A REVOLUTIONARY GROUP.

EXPELLED FROM UNIVERSITY FOR HIS RADICAL POLICIES, LENIN COMPLETED HIS LAW DEGREE AS AN EXTERNAL STUDENT IN 1891. HE MOVED
TO ST PETERSBURG AND BECAME A PROFESSIONAL REVOLUTIONARY. LIKE MANY OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES, HE WAS ARRESTED AND EXILED TO
SIBERIA, WHERE HE MARRIED NADEZHDA KRUPSKAYA. AFTER HIS SIBERIAN EXILE, LENIN - THE PSEUDONYM HE ADOPTED IN 1901 - SPENT
MOST OF THE SUBSEQUENT DECADE AND A HALF IN WESTERN EUROPE, WHERE HE EMERGED AS A PROMINENT FIGURE IN THE INTERNATIONAL
REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT AND BECAME THE LEADER OF THE 'BOLSHEVIK' FACTION OF THE RUSSIAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC WORKER'S PARTY.

IN 1917, EXHAUSTED BY WORLD WAR ONE, RUSSIA WAS RIPE FOR CHANGE. ASSISTED BY THE GERMANS, WHO HOPED THAT HE WOULD
UNDERMINE THE RUSSIAN WAR EFFORT, LENIN RETURNED HOME AND STARTED WORKING AGAINST THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT THAT HAD
OVERTHROWN THE TSARIST REGIME. HE EVENTUALLY LED WHAT WAS SOON TO BE KNOWN AS THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION, BUT WAS
EFFECTIVELY A COUP D'ETAT. ALMOST THREE YEARS OF CIVIL WAR FOLLOWED. THE BOLSHEVIKS WERE VICTORIOUS AND ASSUMED TOTAL
CONTROL OF THE COUNTRY. DURING THIS PERIOD OF REVOLUTION, WAR AND FAMINE, LENIN DEMONSTRATED A CHILLING DISREGARD FOR THE
SUFFERINGS OF HIS FELLOW COUNTRYMEN AND MERCILESSLY CRUSHED ANY OPPOSITION.

ALTHOUGH LENIN WAS RUTHLESS HE WAS ALSO PRAGMATIC. WHEN HIS EFFORTS TO TRANSFORM THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY TO A SOCIALIST
MODEL STALLED, HE INTRODUCED THE NEW ECONOMIC POLICY, WHERE A MEASURE OF PRIVATE ENTERPRISE WAS AGAIN PERMITTED, A POLICY
THAT CONTINUED FOR SEVERAL YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH. IN 1918, LENIN NARROWLY SURVIVED AN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, BUT WAS
SEVERELY WOUNDED. HIS LONG TERM HEALTH WAS AFFECTED, AND IN 1922 HE SUFFERED A STROKE FROM WHICH HE NEVER FULLY
RECOVERED. IN HIS DECLINING YEARS, HE WORRIED ABOUT THE BUREAUCRATISATION OF THE REGIME AND ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER
THE INCREASING POWER OF HIS EVENTUAL SUCCESSOR JOSEPH STALIN. LENIN DIED ON 24 JANUARY 1924. HIS CORPSE WAS EMBALMED AND
PLACED IN A MAUSOLEUM ON Moscow's RED SQUARE.

WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S REPUTATION AS DRAMATIST AND POET ACTOR IS UNIQUE AND HE IS CONSIDERED BY MANY TO BE THE
GREATEST PLAYWRIGHT OF ALL TIME, ALTHOUGH MANY OF THE FACTS OF HIS LIFE REMAIN MYSTERIOUS.

WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE WAS BORN IN STRATFORD-UPON-AVON IN WARWICKSHIRE AND WAS BAPTISED ON 26 APRIL 1564. HIS FATHER WAS A
GLOVEMAKER AND WOOL MERCHANT AND HIS MOTHER, MARY ARDEN, THE DAUGHTER OF A WELL-TO-DO LOCAL LANDOWNER. SHAKESPEARE
WAS PROBABLY EDUCATED IN STRATFORD'S GRAMMAR SCHOOL. THE NEXT DOCUMENTED EVENT IN SHAKESPEARE'S LIFE IS HIS MARRIAGE IN
1582 TO ANNE HATHAWAY, DAUGHTER OF A FARMER. THE COUPLE HAD A DAUGHTER THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND TWINS IN 1585. THERE IS NOW
ANOTHER GAP, REFERRED TO BY SOME SCHOLARS AS 'THE LOST YEARS’, WITH SHAKESPEARE ONLY REAPPEARING IN LONDON IN 1592, WHEN HE
WAS ALREADY WORKING IN THE THEATRE.

SHAKESPEARE'S ACTING CAREER WAS SPENT WITH THE LORD CHAMBERLAIN'S COMPANY, WHICH WAS RENAMED THE KING'S COMPANY IN 1603
WHEN JAMES SUCCEEDED TO THE THRONE. AMONG THE ACTORS IN THE GROUP WAS THE FAMOUS RICHARD BURBAGE. THE PARTNERSHIP
ACQUIRED INTERESTS IN TWO THEATRES IN THE SOUTHWARK AREA OF LONDON, NEAR THE BANKS OF THE THAMES - THE GLOBE AND THE
BLACKFRIARS.

SHAKESPEARE'S POETRY WAS PUBLISHED BEFORE HIS PLAYS, WITH TWO POEMS APPEARING IN 1593 AND 1594, DEDICATED TO HIS PATRON
HENRY WRIOTHESLEY, EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON. MOST OF SHAKESPEARE'S SONNETS WERE PROBABLY WRITTEN AT THIS TIME AS WELL. RECORDS
OF SHAKESPEARE'S PLAYS BEGIN TO APPEAR IN 1594, AND HE PRODUCED ROUGHLY TWO A YEAR UNTIL AROUND 1611. HIS EARLIEST PLAYS
INCLUDE ‘HENRY VI' AND ‘TITUS ANDRONICcUS'. 'A MIDSUMMER NIGHT's DREAM’, "THE MERCHANT OF VENICE’ AND 'RICHARD II' ALL DATE FROM
THE MID TO LATE 1590S. SOME OF HIS MOST FAMOUS TRAGEDIES WERE WRITTEN IN THE EARLY 1600S INCLUDING 'HAMLET’, ‘OTHELLO’, 'KING
LEAR' AND 'MACBETH'. HIs LATE PLAYS, OFTEN KNOWN AS THE ROMANCES, DATE FROM 1608 ONWARDS AND INCLUDE 'THE TEMPEST’.

SHAKESPEARE SPENT THE LAST FIVE YEARS OF HIS LIFE IN STRATFORD, BY NOW A WEALTHY MAN. HE DIED ON 23 APRIL 1616 AND WAS BURIED
»: Hoty TRINITY CHURCH IN STRATFORD. THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF HIS WORKS WAS PUBLISHED IN 1623 AND IS KNOWN AS 'THE FIRST

Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit.

There are three people in yourself:Who people think you are, Who you think you are, and who

Men have died from time to time, and worms have eaten them, but not for love.

How noble in reason! How infinite in faculties!

And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust?

WINSTON LEONARD SPENCER CHURCHILL WAS BORN ON 30 NOVEMBER 1874 AT BLENHEIM PALACE IN OXFORDSHIRE. HIS FATHER WAS THE
PROMINENT TORY POLITICIAN, LORD RANDOLPH CHURCHILL. CHURCHILL ATTENDED THE ROYAL MILITARY COLLEGE, SANDHURST, BEFORE
EMBARKING ON AN ARMY CAREER. HE SAW ACTION ON THE NORTH WEST FRONTIER OF INDIA AND IN THE SUDAN. WHILE WORKING AS A
JOURNALIST DURING THE BOER WAR HE WAS CAPTURED AND MADE A PRISONER-OF-WAR BEFORE ESCAPING.

IN 1900, CHURCHILL BECAME CONSERVATIVE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR OLDHAM. BUT HE BECAME DISAFFECTED WITH HIS PARTY AND

IN 1904 JOINED THE LIBERAL PARTY. WHEN THE LIBERALS WON THE 1905 ELECTION, CHURCHILL WAS APPOINTED UNDERSECRETARY AT THE
COLONIAL OFFICE. IN 1908 HE ENTERED THE CABINET AS PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE, BECOMING HOME SECRETARY IN 1910. THE
FOLLOWING YEAR HE BECAME FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY. HE HELD THIS POST IN THE FIRST MONTHS OF WORLD WAR ONE BUT AFTER THE
DISASTROUS DARDANELLES EXPEDITION, FOR WHICH HE WAS BLAMED, HE RESIGNED. HE JOINED THE ARMY, SERVING FOR A TIME ON THE
WESTERN FRONT. IN 1917, HE WAS BACK IN GOVERNMENT AS MINISTER OF MUNITIONS. FROM 1919 TO 1921 HE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE FOR
WAR AND AIR, AND FROM 1924-1929 WAS CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER.

THE NEXT DECADE WERE HIS 'WILDERNESS YEARS’, IN WHICH HIS OPPOSITION TO INDIAN SELF-RULE AND HIS SUPPORT FOR EDWARD VIII
DURING THE ‘ABDICATION CRISIS' MADE HIM UNPOPULAR, WHILE HIS WARNINGS ABOUT THE RISE OF NAZI GERMANY AND THE NEED FOR
BRITISH REARMAMENT WERE IGNORED. WHEN WAR BROKE OUT IN 1939, CHURCHILL BECAME FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY. IN May 1940,
NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN RESIGNED AS PRIME MINISTER AND CHURCHILL TOOK HIS PLACE. HIS REFUSAL TO SURRENDER TO NAZI GERMANY
INSPIRED THE COUNTRY. HE WORKED TIRELESSLY THROUGHOUT THE WAR, BUILDING STRONG RELATIONS WITH US PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
WHILE MAINTAINING A SOMETIMES DIFFICULT ALLIANCE WITH THE SOVIET UNION.

 

CHURCHILL LOST POWER IN THE 1945 POST-WAR ELECTION BUT REMAINED LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION, VOICING APPREHENSIONS ABOUT THE

COLD WaR (HE POPULARISED THE TERM 'IRON CURTAIN’) AND ENCOURAGING EUROPEAN AND TRANS-ATLANTIC UNITY. IN 1951, HE BECAME
Bw PRIME MINISTER AGAIN. HE RESIGNED IN 1955, BUT REMAINED AN MP UNTIL SHORTLY BEFORE HIS DEATH. AS WELL AS HIS MANY POLITICAL

ACHIEVEMENTS, HE LEFT A LEGACY OF AN IMPRESSIVE NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS AND IN 1953 WON THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR LITERATURE.

CHURCHILL DIED ON 24 JANUARY 1965 AND WAS GIVEN A STATE FUNERAL.

WILL ROGERS WAS FIRST AN INDIAN, A COWBOY AND A NATIONAL FIGURE.

 

BORN IN 1879 ON A LARGE RANCH IN THE CHEROKEE NATION NEAR WHAT LATER WOULD BECOME OOLOGAH, OKLAHOMA, WILL ROGERS

WAS TAUGHT BY A FREED SLAVE HOW TO USE A LASSO AS A TOOL TO WORK TEXAS LONGHORN CATTLE ON THE FAMILY RANCH. AS HE GREW
OLDER, WILL ROGERS’ ROPING SKILLS DEVELOPED SO SPECIAL THAT HE WAS LISTED IN THE GUINNESS BOOK OF RECORDS FOR THROWING
THREE LASSOS AT ONCE: ONE ROPE CAUGHT THE RUNNING HORSE'S NECK, THE OTHER WOULD HOOP AROUND THE RIDER AND THE THIRD
SWOOPED UP UNDER THE HORSE TO LOOP ALL FOUR LEGS. WILL ROGERS' UNSURPASSED LARIAT FEATS WERE RECORDED IN THE CLASSIC MOVIE,
"THE ROPIN' FOOL."

HIS HARD-EARNED SKILLS WON HIM JOBS TRICK ROPING IN WILD WEST SHOWS AND ON THE VAUDEVILLE STAGES WHERE, SOON, HE STARTED
TELLING SMALL JOKES. QUICKLY, HIS WISE CRACKS AND FOLKSY OBSERVATIONS BECAME MORE PRIZED BY AUDIENCES THAN HIS EXPERT ROPING.
HE BECAME RECOGNIZED AS BEING A VERY INFORMED AND SMART PHILOSOPHER--TELLING THE TRUTH IN VERY SIMPLE WORDS SO THAT
EVERYONE COULD UNDERSTAND. AFTER THE 10TH GRADE, WILL ROGERS DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL TO BECOME A COWBOY IN A CATTLE DRIVE.
HE ALWAYS REGRETTED THAT HE DIDN'T FINISH SCHOOL, BUT HE MADE SURE THAT HE NEVER STOPPED LEARNING--READING, THINKING AND
TALKING TO SMART PEOPLE. HIS HARD WORK PAID OFF.

WILL ROGERS WAS THE STAR OF BROADWAY AND 71 MOVIES OF THE 1920S AND 1930S; A POPULAR BROADCASTER; BESIDES WRITING MORE
THAN 4,000 SYNDICATED NEWSPAPER COLUMNS AND BEFRIENDING PRESIDENTS, SENATORS AND KINGS. DURING HIS LIFETIME, HE TRAVELED
AROUND THE GLOBE THREE TIMES-- MEETING PEOPLE, COVERING WARS, TALKING ABOUT PEACE AND LEARNING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE.

HE WROTE SIX BOOKS. IN FACT HE PUBLISHED MORE THAN TWO MILLION WORDS. HE WAS THE FIRST BIG TIME RADIO COMMENTATOR, WAS A
GUEST AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND HIS OPINIONS WERE SOUGHT BY THE LEADERS OF THE WORLD. INSIDE HIMSELF, WILL ROGERS REMAINED A
SIMPLE OKLAHOMA COWBOY. "I NEVER MET A MAN I DIDN'T LIKE," WAS HIS CREDO OF GENUINE LOVE AND RESPECT FOR HUMANITY AND ALL
PEOPLE EVERYWHERE. HE GAVE HIS OWN MONEY TO DISASTER VICTIMS AND RAISED THOUSANDS FOR THE RED CROSS AND SALVATION ARMY.

 

 

AT HOME, EITHER ON HIS RANCH IN OKLAHOMA OR CALIFORNIA, HE ALWAYS ENJOYED RIDING HORSEBACK, ROPING STEERS OR PLAYING POLO.
HE WOULD SCRATCH HIS HEAD, GRIN AND QUIP THAT HE FIGURED THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH ANYBODY THAT DIDN'T LIKE A HORSE.
JIM ROGERS, 1915-2000, AFTER STARRING IN SOME COWBOY MOVIES AS A YOUNG MAN, SPENT HIS LIFE AS A HORSE AND CATTLE RANCHER.
BETTY AND WILL ROGERS'S YOUNGEST SON, FRED, DIED OF DIPHTHERIA WHEN HE WAS TWO. THERE WERE EIGHT CHILDREN BORN TO WILL
ROGERS' PARENTS, BUT ONLY FOUR REACHED ADULTHOOD ON THE RUGGED FRONTIER OF 19TH CENTURY INDIAN TERRITORY.
