I would also give a special thanks to Robert Thomas, author of
“Wall Street Wit and Wisdom” for giving me the inspiration and
all the advice he gave me while I was putting this book together.

I could not have done it without your help.

Thank you very much.
 Introduction

If you are like most people, you know it can be hard to stay
motivated and focused 365 days a year whether it be at work,
home, school, etc. Especially on those gloomy Monday mornings.
Some people listen to their favorite song to get them energized,
some read an uplifting story, and others may watch an inspiring
movie...the list goes on. I happen to like reading quotes of
successful people. I have quotes placed anywhere that I can see
them; in my bedroom, my car, and in my office. Sometimes I
come into the office and feel a little lethargic and Jess motivated
than I should be in order to do my job effectively. I need
something extra besides a cup of strong coffee to get me going.
All I do is read a quote from my favorite author or businessman,
and I seem to get myself back on track. I put this collection of
quotes together to help you do the same. We all have the
capabilities to achieve just as much success in life as anyone else.
All we need to do is stay motivated and focused, have specific
goals and act on them. My hope is that this book gives all of you
the extra push you need to get out there and grab life by the horns
and achieve all the success life has to offer.
